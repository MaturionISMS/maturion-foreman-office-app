## Standardisation Tasks Completed

- [x] ✅ Applied minimum-architecture-template standards to all modules
- [x] ✅ Identified missing architecture components per module
- [x] ✅ Validated True North completeness
- [x] ✅ Analyzed dependency graph and circular dependencies
- [x] ✅ Checked version consistency across documents
- [x] ✅ Verified architecture → QA → compliance linkage
- [x] ✅ Generated Module Readiness Reports for all modules
- [x] ✅ Created prioritized fix backlog
- [x] ✅ Generated sequencing plan for builder agents

---

## Key Findings

### Critical Gaps

✅ No critical gaps found.

### Architecture Completeness

### Dependency Analysis

⚠️ **2 circular dependency chains detected**
- WRAC → PIT → WRAC
- THREAT → VULNERABILITY → THREAT

### Version Consistency

⚠️ **3 version consistency issues**

### QA & Compliance Linkage

**Fully Linked Modules**: 0/7 (0.0%)

## Deliverables

All standardisation deliverables have been generated:

1. ✅ **STANDARDISATION_REPORT.md** (this document)
2. ✅ **MODULE_READINESS_REPORTS/** - Individual reports for each module
3. ✅ **FIX_BACKLOG.md** - Prioritized issues requiring resolution
4. ✅ **BUILDER_SEQUENCING_PLAN.md** - Task sequencing for builder agents
5. ✅ **standardisation_results.json** - Machine-readable results

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Review Module Readiness Reports** - Examine individual module reports in `MODULE_READINESS_REPORTS/`
2. **Address Critical Issues** - Resolve Priority 1 issues in FIX_BACKLOG.md
3. **Create Missing Components** - Generate placeholder documents for missing architecture files
4. **Resolve Dependencies** - Address circular dependencies identified
5. **Normalize Versions** - Standardize document versions across modules
6. **Complete Linkages** - Establish architecture → QA → compliance chains for all modules

### Builder Agent Coordination

Once critical gaps are addressed:

1. Follow the sequencing plan in BUILDER_SEQUENCING_PLAN.md
2. Assign tasks to appropriate builder agents
3. Execute builds in dependency order
4. Validate each build against architecture standards
5. Run QA-of-QA validation before integration

---

## Recommendations

1. **Architecture Completion**: 1 modules need architecture work before build readiness
2. **Dependency Refactoring**: Resolve 2 circular dependencies
3. **Compliance Mapping**: Complete compliance linkage for 7 modules
