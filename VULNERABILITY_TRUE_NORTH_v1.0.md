0. PURPOSE

The Vulnerability Module is the structural backbone of the SRMF.
It maps the real-world architecture of the organisation — processes, lifecycles, facilities — and identifies vulnerability points that can be exploited by threats.

It serves four critical functions:

Structural Mapping
Build the organisation’s operational architecture (Processes → Lifecycles → Facilities).

Vulnerability Identification
Capture & analyse vulnerabilities across all structures.

Threat–Vulnerability Linking
Connect mapped vulnerabilities to threats, generating unwanted events (UEs).

Pipeline Input
Feed the RA Engine, WRAC, PIT, Control Library, Remote Assurance, and Intelligence modules.

The Vulnerability Module is not optional:
It is the gateway that binds real-world operations with formal risk quantification.

3. CORE CONCEPTS

The Vulnerability Module revolves around four conceptual cores:

3.1 Organisational Architecture Tree

Every company has:

Company
   ├── Zones / Regions (optional)
   │      ├── Plants
   │      │     ├── Facilities
   │      │     │       └── Process Chains
   │      │     │               └── Lifecycle Steps


Every node is:

Represented as a unique structure

Mapped to vulnerability records

Mapped to threats

Involved in RA generation

3.2 Vulnerability Nodes

A vulnerability is:

A weakness in a process, lifecycle stage, or facility
that allows a threat to manifest into an unwanted event.


Each vulnerability node includes:

Description

Category

Severity

Evidence (optional)

Location in the architecture

Responsible custodians

3.3 Threat–Vulnerability Relevance Engine (TVRE)

This engine evaluates:

If a threat can exploit the vulnerability

How relevant the threat’s TTPs are

Whether the UE is valid

Invalid combinations are auto-rejected.

3.4 Evidence & Markup System

Brown-paper method converted to digital

Upload floor plans, pictures, diagrams

AI markup detection

Node tagging system

Evidence chain-of-custody
