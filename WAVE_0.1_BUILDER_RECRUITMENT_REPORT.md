✅ Recruited builders from manifest  
✅ Validated builder configurations  
✅ Generated documentation and evidence  
✅ Produced readiness certification (next step)

### 5.2 FM Authority NOT Exercised (Out of Scope)

FM did NOT:

CS2 (Johan) will need to execute the following GitHub platform actions:

1. Review and approve this recruitment report
2. Review and approve the readiness certification (to be generated)
3. Execute any issue/PR operations as needed for next wave
4. Provide human validation at gates

All CS2 actions should be annotated:
> "Human bootstrap execution proxy on behalf of FM (Wave 0)"

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Generate Readiness Certification**
   - Document: `WAVE_0.1_READINESS_CERTIFICATION.md`
   - Certify that builders are ready for task assignment
   - Provide evidence and scope lock confirmation

2. **Request CS2 Approval**
   - Submit all Wave 0.1 deliverables for CS2 review
   - Obtain approval to proceed to next wave

3. **Define Wave 0.2 (if applicable)**
   - If additional bootstrap waves are needed, define Wave 0.2 scope
   - Otherwise, prepare for transition to normal build waves

### 8.2 Long-Term Recommendations

1. **Builder Performance Monitoring**
   - Track builder task completion rates
   - Monitor builder adherence to boundaries
   - Adjust specifications if needed

2. **Governance Evolution**
   - Continue refining builder specifications based on actual usage
   - Update capability maps as builders take on new responsibilities
   - Maintain permission policies as repo structure evolves

3. **Automation Transition**
   - Plan transition from bootstrap (manual) to normal (automated) execution
   - Define criteria for when CS2 execution proxy is no longer needed
   - Establish delegation mechanisms for builder task assignment
