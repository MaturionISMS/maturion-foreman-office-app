- ⚠️  Circular dependencies detected: ['WRAC -> PIT', 'VULNERABILITY -> THREAT']

---

## Recommendation

⚠️  **BUILD WAVE 1 PLANNING IS COMPLETE WITH WARNINGS**

All critical deliverables are present, but some warnings exist.
Review warnings before proceeding. Build Wave 1 can proceed with Johan's approval.

**Warnings to address**:
- Circular dependencies between WRAC ↔ PIT and VULNERABILITY ↔ THREAT should be resolved using event-driven architecture before Wave 2 full implementation
- These circular dependencies do NOT block Wave 1 skeleton builds
- Change Records have been created to track resolution of these architectural issues
