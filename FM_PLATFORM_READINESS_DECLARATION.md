## Phase
**Phase 3.2 — FM Platform Readiness Declaration**

---

## Authority

This declaration is issued under the **Platform Readiness Reset & Build Initiation Plan**  
after completion of all prerequisite governance and enforcement phases.

Preconditions satisfied:

- Phase 1.1 — Governance Artifact Inventory ✅
- Phase 1.2 — Platform Readiness Definition Gap Analysis ✅
- Phase 2.1 — Governance Canon Update (BL-009 Closure) ✅
- Phase 2.2 — Governance Layer-Down to FM App ✅
- Phase 2.3 — Workflow Enforcement Alignment ✅
- Phase 3.1 — FM Platform Readiness Inspection ✅

## Declaration

I hereby declare that the **Foreman App platform is READY** to proceed with
governed build execution.

This declaration is made with the following confirmations:

### Governance & Canon
- Governance canon v2.0.0 is fully layered down
- Bootstrap Learnings BL-010 through BL-014 are present and enforceable
- No unresolved governance gaps remain

### Enforcement & Workflows
- All enforceable readiness rules are deterministically enforced
- PR gate workflows produce explicit outcomes (GREEN / SKIP / FAIL)
- No human interpretation or ad-hoc authorization is required
- Agents can operate autonomously within defined governance boundaries

### Platform Operability
- Repository structure is usable for build orchestration
- Evidence and reporting mechanisms are in place
- No build execution has commenced
- No builders have been recruited
- No architecture or QA work has begun

## Explicit Deferrals (Non-Blocking)

The following item is **intentionally deferred** and does not block build initiation:

- **GitHub Branch Protection Automation**

Rationale:
- Existing governance-enforced PR gates and QA mechanisms provide stronger,
  deterministic enforcement within this execution model
- Branch protection is a platform-native convenience control suited to coder
  environments
- Automation will be revisited as a future optimization

This deferral is recorded by design and does not constitute a readiness gap.

---

## Scope Boundaries

This declaration:

- ✅ Authorizes progression to **Phase 4 — Build Initiation**
- ❌ Does NOT authorize immediate build execution
- ❌ Does NOT authorize builder recruitment
- ❌ Does NOT approve architecture or QA work

All subsequent actions must follow Phase 4 sequencing.

---

## Ratchet Statement

Governance is complete.  
Enforcement is deterministic.  
The platform is ready to build.
