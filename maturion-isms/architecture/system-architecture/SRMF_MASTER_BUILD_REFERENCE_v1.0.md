All file references, dependencies, and version paths

This file ensures:

Zero loss of context

Zero ambiguity

Zero regression

One-time build correctness

Full architectural alignment across all modules

Scalability for future extensions

Every module, submodule, and dataset in the ISMS ecosystem connects back to this master reference.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1 What the ISMS + SRMF Is

The Maturion ISMS is a fully integrated, modular security management platform designed to support:

Security

Operational integrity

Environmental protection

Health & safety

Compliance

Corporate governance

Threat intelligence

Risk management

Project implementation

Assurance

Continuous improvement

The Security Risk Mitigation Framework (SRMF) inside the ISMS provides:

Threat → Vulnerability → UE → Risk Assessment → Controls
→ Residual & Projected Risk → Implementation (PIT)
→ Remote Assurance → Live Risk → Incident & Intelligence → Feedback Loop


All modules are:

Multi-company

Multi-hierarchy

Multi-disciplinary

Multi-risk-axis capable

1.2 SRMF’s Core Principles

Integration by Design
Every module connects upstream & downstream. No silos.

Deterministic Architecture
All calculations are rule-based and repeatable.

One-Time Build Philosophy
The system is built once, correctly, and expanded without rework.

Zero Regression Mandate
No future update invalidates prior logic or produces conflicting behaviour.

Scalability & Flexibility
Works for small operations, large multinationals, and government agencies.

Automation First
AI and Watchdogs automate 70–90% of the mechanical workload.

Human Governance
Human role: approve, review, oversee — not perform mechanical repetition.

Auditability & Transparency
Every calculation, AI action, and workflow transition is logged.

2. MATURION BUILD PHILOSOPHY (ONE-TIME BUILD)

Derived from your True North and Build Philosophy documents.

2.1 No Shortcuts

Every component must be built correctly the first time, from the smallest low-level edge function to the largest model-routing specification.

2.2 No Legacy Debt

No “temporary” logic is allowed in production.

2.3 Architectural Traceability

Every module references its True North and is linked in this master document.

2.4 Module Independence + System Integration

Each module works independently but integrates perfectly:

All modules expose clean data contracts

All modules adhere to shared conventions

No circular dependencies

All cross-module calls are deterministic

2.5 Progressive Enhancement

The system grows by adding new modules, not rewriting old ones.

2.6 AI-First Logic

AI performs:

Drafting

Summaries

Refinements

Explanations

Filtering

Matching

Pattern detection

Vision analysis

But AI never bypasses human approval or commit logic.

2.7 Watchdog Governance

Automated watchdogs enforce:

Correct configuration

Consistency

Pipeline continuity

Relevance scores

Drift recalculation

Control integrity

Risk vs appetite

Implementation progress

Each submodule interacts with the rest of SRMF.

5.4 THREAT CATEGORY CATALOGUE (v1.1)

Threat categories are standardized and include:

Adversarial

Theft

Hijacking

Robbery

Sabotage

Insider collusion

Syndicate activity

Fraud

Cyber intrusion

Physical intrusion

Corruption

Non-Adversarial

Equipment failure

Natural disaster

Structural collapse

Environmental hazards

Human error

Unplanned operational disruption

Each category contains:

Definition

Examples

Recommended controls

Associated vulnerabilities

Associated TTPs

Severity indicators

5.5 THREAT ACTOR PROFILES

Each threat can be linked to actors:

Opportunistic criminals

Organized crime syndicates

Insiders

Contractors

Activists

Competitors

State actors

Automated systems (cyberbotnets)

Natural forces (non-human)

Each actor has properties:

Capability

Intent

Resources

Historical patterns

Preferred TTPs

Geographic region

5.6 THREAT SCORING MODEL (v1.1)
CORE SCORES

Each threat receives:

Capability Score (0–1.0)

Intent Score (0–1.0)

Opportunity Score (0–1.0)

Context Score (0–1.0)

Drift Adjustment (+ / –)

THREAT SCORE SYNTAX
threat_score = (capability × intent × opportunity × context) + drift_adjustment

DECISION RULES

If threat_score ≥ 0.7 → high concern

If actor = syndicate → apply multiplier

If internal incident occurred → apply recency modifier

If intelligence suggests increase → adjust drift

5.7 THREAT DRIFT ENGINE (v1.1)

Threat drift detects evolving patterns:

Inputs

Changes in TTP usage

Crime reports

Internal incidents

Unusual anomalies

Time since last incident

Industry trends

Intelligence feeds

Drift Score Behavior
0.00 → stable
0.20 → mild drift
0.50 → significant drift
0.80+ → critical drift

Drift Effects

Recalculates TVRE

Recalculates RA scores

Triggers Watchdog events

Suggests re-assessment of UE

May escalate risk beyond appetite

Drift Decay

If no indicators appear, drift decays gradually over time.

5.8 TTP CATALOGUE (MITRE-ALIGNED)

TTPs describe how a threat is executed.

Each threat links to relevant TTPs:

T109: Access through lock manipulation

T122: Insider credential abuse

T105: Subversion of physical barriers

T204: Social engineering

T319: Bribery / coercion

etc.

TTP Metadata

Description

Likelihood of use

Conditions required

Common vulnerabilities exploited

Evidence signatures

These TTPs link directly to vulnerabilities.

5.9 THREAT–VULNERABILITY MATCHING RULES
Matching Logic

A threat can match a vulnerability if:

Their categories align

The TTP exploits the vulnerability

The actor profile matches the environment

TVRE > threshold

Drift supports increased relevance

Invalid matches must be auto-rejected.

Example

Threat: “Insider information theft”

Vulnerability: “Lack of segregation of duties”

TTP: “Credential misuse”

→ Valid.

Example invalid

Threat: “Tornado”

Vulnerability: “Weak password policy”

→ Auto-reject.

6. VULNERABILITY MODULE — FULL DEEP INDEX
6.1 MODULE PURPOSE

The Vulnerability Module identifies, maps, evaluates, and contextualizes:

Organizational weaknesses

Environmental weaknesses

Process gaps

Facility deficiencies

Human-machine interaction issues

6.8 VULNERABILITY SCORING MODEL (v1.1)
Severity Score

How damaging the vulnerability is if exploited.

Scale: 0.00 – 1.00

Exploitability Score

How easy it is to exploit.

Scale: 0.00 – 1.00

Formula
vulnerability_score = severity × exploitability


Severity examples:

Missing access control → severe

Dim lighting → moderate

Missing policy → variable

Exploitability examples:

Open door → high

Badge misuse → medium

Policy gap → depends on context

6.9 THREAT–VULNERABILITY RELEVANCE (TVRE) INTEGRATION

TVRE determines whether a vulnerability can produce an unwanted event.

Inputs

Threat capability

Vulnerability exploitability

TTP alignment

Context

Drift adjustments

Behavior

If:

TVRE > threshold


→ UE candidate is generated.

If:

TVRE < threshold


→ No UE.

Auto-Reject Logic

Invalid combinations automatically rejected:

Natural disaster threat + Password reuse → invalid

Financial fraud threat + Rusted steel beam → invalid

6.10 CUSTODIAN TEAM ASSIGNMENT

Every vulnerability is owned by a custodian team:

Operations

Security

Maintenance

HR

IT

Environment

Engineering

Custodians:

Provide evidence

Review vulnerability status

Approve closure

7.6 NIST LIKELIHOOD ENGINE (v1.1)
Components

The NIST likelihood engine is divided into three components:

Initiation Likelihood (Adversarial)

Capability

Intent

Opportunity

TTP complexity

Occurrence Likelihood (Non-Adversarial)

Frequency

Environmental factors

Exposure

Adverse Impact Likelihood

Probability that harm is realized after initiation/occurrence

Each is scored 0–1.0.

FINAL LIKELIHOOD SCORE
likelihood_raw = weighted sum of 3 components
likelihood_adjusted = likelihood_raw + drift_adjustment
likelihood_normalized = clamp(0, 1.0)

Mapping to ERM

Mapped into:

Rare

Unlikely

Possible

Likely

Almost Certain

7.7 ERM IMPACT ENGINE (v1.1)

Impact is computed across:

Financial

Human safety

Environmental

Regulatory

Operational

Weighted per ERM settings.

Overall Impact Score
impact_score = weighted composite

Impact Level

Mapped from:

Impact Score

ALE override (if triggered)

ALE Impact Mapping

If ALE > threshold, impact level may escalate.

7.8 ALE QUANTIFICATION ENGINE

ALE is used if:

Asset value known

Exposure known

Annual rate of occurrence estimated

Formula:

ALE = asset_value × exposure_rate × ARO


Mapped into:

Minor

Moderate

Major

Severe

Critical

ALE is optional but recommended.

7.9 INHERENT RISK CALCULATOR
inherent_risk = matrix[likelihood_level][impact_level]

Example

Likelihood: Likely
Impact: Major

→ Inherent Risk: High (red)

Stored as:

Score

Level

Band

Color

7.10 EXISTING CONTROL EVALUATION (v1.1)

Existing controls evaluated using:

Design Strength

Implementation Quality

Availability

Efficacy formula:

control_efficacy = (design × implementation × availability)


Aggregated across controls:

total_current_effectiveness = 1 - ∏(1 - each_control_efficacy)

Capped at 90%

No control environment can exceed 90% effectiveness.

7.11 RESIDUAL RISK CALCULATION
residual_likelihood = inherent_likelihood × (1 - effectiveness)
residual_impact = inherent_impact × (1 - effectiveness)
residual_risk = matrix[residual_likelihood][residual_impact]


Residual risk must:

Never exceed inherent

Always be logic-checked

7.12 PROPOSED CONTROLS EVALUATION

Proposed controls evaluated similarly:

projected_effectiveness = calculated as above but using proposed controls


Combined:

total_effectiveness = current_effectiveness + proposed_effectiveness

Capped at 90% again.
7.13 PROJECTED RISK
projected_likelihood = inherent_likelihood × (1 - total_effectiveness)
projected_impact = inherent_impact × (1 - total_effectiveness)
projected_risk = matrix[projected_likelihood][projected_impact]


Displayed in WRAC as:

Heatmap coordinate

Heatmap descriptor

Risk value

Remaining risk %

7.14 ROI MODEL
expected_loss_prevented = ALE_inherent - ALE_projected
roi = (expected_loss_prevented - control_cost) / control_cost


ROI expressed as:

Percentage

Positive = beneficial

Negative = not viable

7.15 APPETITE COMPARISON ENGINE

Appetite is applied three times:

Inherent vs appetite

Residual vs appetite

Projected vs appetite

Flags:

Within appetite

Slightly above appetite

Breach

Critical breach

Triggers:

If inherent > appetite → escalate

If projected > appetite → controls insufficient

7.16 CONTROL STRATEGY ENGINE (v1.1)

Creates:

Immediate controls

Medium-term

Long-term

“Control sets”

Each control:

Has cost

Has dependencies

Has efficacy

Belongs to category (Eliminate, Sub, Engineer, Admin, PPE)

Control sets:

Bundled controls

Applied to multiple risks

Exportable to PIT

8.6 WRAC → RA LINKAGE

Every WRAC row is a direct projection of:

Inherent risk from RA

Residual risk from RA

Projected risk from RA

Control strategy from RA

ROI from RA

Appetite comparison from RA

WRAC never recalculates risk.

WRAC is the primary UI where the user:

Views control sets

Adds or removes proposed controls

Sees how controls affect projected risk

Sees ROI

Groups controls into implementation units

Approves final mitigation plans

8.8 PUE (PRIORITY UNWANTED EVENT) LOGIC

A risk becomes a PUE if:

Residual risk > appetite

Projected risk > appetite

Control environment contains critical controls

Residual remains high despite controls

Uncertainty indicators exist (missing evidence, drift ≥ threshold)

8.11 CONTROL CATEGORIES & SUB-CATEGORIES
Primary control categories:

Elimination

Substitution

Engineering Controls

Administrative Controls

PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

Subcategories Example (Engineering):

CCTV cameras

Access control systems

Fencing

Alarm systems

SCADA controls

IoT sensors

Black-screen analytics

Machine-learning alerts

Each control entry includes:

Definition

When used

Strengths

Weaknesses

Evidence requirements

Typical failure points

8.12 CONTROL DEPENDENCIES (CRITICAL FOR SRMF)

Controls often rely on other controls to be effective.

Example

“Camera coverage” depends on:

Power stability

Network availability

Surveillance operator

Recording system

AI analytics (if configured)

Dependency types:

Hard dependency (mandatory)

Soft dependency (recommended)

Contextual dependency (specific scenarios)

SRMF automatically checks dependencies:

In RA

In WRAC

In PIT

In Assurance

8.13 CONTROL COSTING MODEL

Two cost levels:

1. Preliminary Costing (75% Accuracy)

Used during RA and WRAC.
Based on:

Control category

Estimated complexity

Market price profiles

Labor

Materials

2. Actual Costing (Final Pricing)

Triggered when project is exported to PIT.

Requests quotes

Approvals required

Procurement process

Timeline estimation

Both are stored in the control object.

8.14 CONTROL EVIDENCE MODEL

Controls require evidence:

Photos

Checklists

Logs

System uptime/alarm history

CCTV snapshots

Maintenance reports

Test reports

Evidence is:

Attached

Versioned

Required for “active” status

Assurance module checks evidence automatically (where possible).

8.15 CONTROL EFFICACY ENGINE (v1.1)

This is the mathematical engine that determines how much a control reduces risk.

Each control evaluated across:

Design Strength

Implementation Quality

Availability

Base Formula
control_efficacy = design × implementation × availability

Aggregated Control Environment
total_effectiveness = 1 - ∏(1 - control_efficacy_i)

Hard Cap

90% maximum effectiveness
No controls can eliminate 100% of risk.

8.16 CONTROL SETS (GROUPINGS)

A control set is a logical group of controls that mitigate:

a specific vulnerability

a specific threat vector

a collection of risks

Examples:

“Surveillance Hardening Set”:

Camera coverage

3-tier monitoring

Black-screen AI

System availability monitoring

“Access Control Integrity Set”:

Credential vetting

Anti-passback

Door hardening

Segregation of duties

Control sets are essential for:

RA → WRAC

WRAC → PIT

Batch implementation planning

ROI across multiple risks

8.17 CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCING

Controls are sequenced as:

Implement now

Implement medium-term

Implement future

Conditional on other controls

The RA and WRAC modules decide the classification.
PIT handles actual implementation.

8.18 WRAC → LIVE RISK DASHBOARD (INTEGRATION)

Live Risk Dashboard uses:

Control availability (from Assurance)

Control completion (from PIT)

Threat drift (from Threat module)

Vulnerability updates

UE changes

Real-time control efficacy recalculations

WRAC values dynamically update.

8.19 WRAC WATCHDOG RULES
Severity	Trigger
Critical	PUE without Bowtie assignment
Critical	Projected risk > Residual risk
High	Missing control costing
High	Control dependency missing
Medium	Incomplete WRAC row
Low	Control group mismatch
8.20 CONTROL LIBRARY WATCHDOG RULES
Severity	Trigger
Critical	Control with missing category
High	No efficacy values
Medium	No evidence rules
Low	Missing cost estimate
8.21 VERSIONING & GOVERNANCE

Control Library and Efficacy Engine must store:

Version

Change logs

Update reasons

Cross-module impact scans

Updating control library must:

Recalculate RA

Recalculate WRAC

Recalculate projected risk

8.22 FUTURE EXTENSIONS
Bowtie Module

WRAC will directly feed bowtie risk assessments.

Remote Assurance AI

Will verify control availability using:

CCTV analytics

Access control logs

Alarm system uptimes

Syndicate Control Library

Controls targeted specifically at organized crime patterns.

9.1 PURPOSE OF THE TIER-3 LAYER

Tier-3 consists of:

1. PIT — ensuring controls are implemented.

This closes the loop between RA → WRAC → Action.

2. Remote Assurance — ensuring controls remain available & effective.

This converts controls into live risk indicators.

This ensures early warning and automatic RA updates.

Together, these modules:

Turn analyses into actions

Turn actions into verified improvements

Turn verification into live risk analytics

Turn intelligence into RA recalculations

This is the backbone of a dynamic, living SRMF.

9.2 PIT (PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION TRACKER) — DEEP INDEX

The PIT system transforms control strategies into trackable implementation projects.

PIT receives inputs from:

WRAC

RA

Owner Approvals

PUE escalation workflow

PIT exports to:

Remote Assurance

Live Risk Dashboard

Bowtie escalation

Auditors

Executive dashboards

10.5 SRMF AI ROUTING SPECIFICATION

(This is essential for Foreman & CoPilot orchestration)

The SRMF AI layer must follow strict boundaries.

AI CAN:

Analyze threats

Suggest vulnerabilities

Draft UE sentences

Calculate likelihood values

Propose controls

Compute risk values

Interpret telemetry (Assurance)

Predict failure modes

Summarize RAs

Draft PIT task structures

Detect anomalies in systems

Recommend focus areas to executives

AI CANNOT:

Approve RA

Modify ERM

Grant PIT completions

Change risk appetite

Change governance settings

Conceal watchdog failures

Override a human decision

AI ALWAYS:

Logs every action

Requires human sign-off for major steps

Must reference SRMF rules when providing reasoning

Must justify all recommendations

10.6 MASTER DATA MODEL

(Complete Unified Entity Relationship Overview)

Core Entities

Company

Hierarchy Node

Threat

Vulnerability

UE

Risk

Control

Control Set

PIT Project

PIT Task

Assurance Signal

Incident

Intelligence Feed

Crosslinks

Threat ↔ Vulnerability (TVRE logic)

UE links Threat + Vulnerability

RA links UE + Controls + ERM

WRAC links RA + Controls + ROI

PIT links Controls + RA

Assurance links Controls + PIT

Incidents update Threats & RA

This unified model ensures every module speaks the same data language.

10.7 MASTER VERSIONING ARCHITECTURE

Every major module maintains its own version, but a global SRMF version also exists.

Version Types

ERM version

Threat library version

Vulnerability mapping version

Control library version

Efficacy model version

RA version

WRAC version

PIT version

Assurance version

Intelligence version

Version Conflicts

If a control library update changes efficacy:

RA recalculates

WRAC updates

PIT re-evaluates

Live residual adjusts

THERE IS NEVER A “silent” update.

10.8 GOVERNANCE & APPROVAL HIERARCHY

Hierarchy defines:

Who approves RA

Who approves WRAC

Who approves controls

Who approves budgets

Who verifies evidence

Who approves PIT projects

Who accepts completed controls

Who signs off residual risk

Governance roles include:

Analyst

Custodian

Risk Owner

Approver

PIT Manager

Assurance Officer

Auditor

Executive

Each step MUST be human-verified.

10.9 MASTER WATCHDOG FRAMEWORK

Watchdog layers:

Threat Watchdog

Vulnerability Watchdog

RA Watchdog

WRAC Watchdog

PIT Watchdog

Assurance Watchdog

Incident Watchdog

Severity levels:

Informational

Low

Medium

High

Critical

Critical watchdog events require:

Forced escalation

Executive notification

System locking (certain actions)

10.10 MASTER AUDIT & TRACEABILITY ENGINE

Everything is logged:

RA changes

UE modifications

Threat drift updates

PIT task updates

Evidence uploads

Assurance failures

Intelligence triggers

AI recommendations

AI reasoning snippets

Auditors can reconstruct:

Any risk

Any control

Any timeline

Any evidence

Any decision

Any change

10.11 EXECUTIVE DASHBOARDS INTEGRATION

Dashboards show:

Top risks

Risk over time

Risk vs appetite

PUE list

Control health

Control failures

Incident heatmaps

Implementation progress

ROI summary

Future risk forecasts (AI)

Executives see ONE system, not 10 modules.

10.12 FUTURE EXPANSION PATHWAYS

The SRMF architecture allows seamless addition of:

Digital Twin

AI-driven patrol planning

Predictive threat modeling

SRMF UI NAVIGATION & WIZARD FLOWS (v1.0)

Purpose: Define a consistent, minimalistic, wizard-driven UI across all SRMF modules so that the system feels like one app, not a patchwork.

11.1 GLOBAL UI SHELL

All SRMF modules run inside a shared ISMS shell:

Top Bar

Left: Maturion logo + environment (Prod / UAT)

Center: Module title (ERM, Threats, RA, WRAC, PIT, etc.)

Right: User profile, role, notifications bell, AI Assistant button

Left Sidebar (Primary Navigation)

ISMS Home

Risk Management

ERM

Threats

Vulnerabilities

Risk Assessment

WRAC

PIT

Remote Assurance

Incident & Intelligence

Other Modules

Course Crafter

Policy Builder

Auditor App

Skills Portal

Admin

Company Settings

Hierarchy

Control Library

User & Roles

Watchdog Console

Logs & Audit

Main Content Area

Module screens (lists, details, wizards, dashboards)

Always a split structure:

Primary pane (data)

Context pane (AI, details, hints, help)

Bottom Status Strip (optional)

Current company & hierarchy node

Active ERM profile

Active SRMF version

Watchdog status indicator (green/amber/red)

11.2 NAVIGATION PRINCIPLES

Wizard over chaos
Users move through complex flows via guided steps, not free-form chaos.

Same pattern across modules
Threat, Vulnerability, RA, WRAC, PIT, Assurance – all use the same UX grammar.

AI always “to the right”, not “in your face”
A contextual AI side-panel assists but doesn’t disturb the core flow.

Hierarchy + Filters always visible
So the user always knows which mine/plant/zone/process they are working in.

Everything 2–3 clicks away from anywhere
Navigation is never deep and tangled.

11.4 GLOBAL “RISK PIPELINE” NAVIGATION VIEW

There should be a single visual “pipeline” view that lets users jump into any module in context:

[Threats] → [Vulnerabilities] → [UE] → [Risk Assessment] → [WRAC] → [PIT] → [Remote Assurance]


Each box is clickable.

If a risk is selected, jumping between steps keeps context (same UE / risk / controls).

A “Pipeline” tab appears on RA/WRAC/PIT screens.

11.5 WIZARD STRUCTURE — SHARED PATTERN

Across the system, the wizard pattern should be:

Step 1: Context
Step 2: Inputs
Step 3: AI Draft
Step 4: Human Edit & Approve
Step 5: Export / Commit


Applied differently per module, but same mental model.

User edits, groups, sequences tasks

Define dependencies

Step 3 — Costing & Timeline

Preliminary cost automatically pulled from control library

User can override or request detailed costing

Define planned start & end dates

Step 4 — Responsibility & Governance

Assign project owner

Assign task owners

Approvers defined

Step 5 — Monitoring View

Summary chart: progress, cost vs. plan, schedule vs. plan

“Create PIT Project” finalizes.

11.12 REMOTE ASSURANCE — UI & DASHBOARD
Assurance Dashboard View

Cards showing:

“Overall Control Availability” (percentage)

“Top 10 Control Failures”

“Systems health: CCTV / Access / Alarms / SCADA”

“Manual checklist compliance”

“Assurance-related risk spikes”

Control Health View

Table listing controls: Name, Node, Category, Availability %, Failure count, Impacted risks, Status.

Clicking a control shows:

Uptime graphs

Recent failures

Linked RA & WRAC entries

Linked incidents

11.13 INCIDENT & INTELLIGENCE — UI & FLOW
Incident List View

Columns: Incident type, Location, Severity, Linked threats, Linked RA, Status.

Incident Intake Wizard

Step 1 — Basic Details

Time, place, type, severity.

Step 2 — Evidence Upload

Reports, photos, video clips, logs.

Step 3 — SRMF Impact

AI suggests:

Threats impacted

Vulnerabilities indicated

UEs potentially triggered

Step 4 — Action

Create or update Threat

Create new Vulnerability

Flag existing RA for review

11.14 CONTROL LIBRARY — UI
Library View

Search by control name, category, risk type, threat, vulnerability

Columns: Control name, Category, Base efficacy, Cost band, Dependencies, Evidence type

11.15 AI ASSISTANT UI (GLOBAL PATTERN)

The AI panel appears as a right-side drawer available in all major modules.

Features:

“Explain this screen”

“Help me design…” (threat, vulnerability, RA, control strategy, PIT plan)

“Summarise selected items”

“Highlight anomalies”

“Generate export-ready narrative”

Important:

AI never hides core data; it assists, it doesn’t dominate.

AI outputs always show “why” (short explanation anchored in ERM/SRMF rules).

11.16 MINIMALIST VISUAL LANGUAGE

The entire UI should be:

Clean, non-cluttered

Limited, consistent color use:

Neutrals for chrome

Heatmap colors only where risk is shown

Clear icons for status/severity

Whites/greys with accent color per module (but all from one design system).

Typography: one primary typeface with hierarchical sizing.

11.17 ACCESSIBILITY & RESPONSIVENESS

Keyboard navigable

High contrast option

Mobile-friendly “lite” views for:

Auditor mobile app

Checklist completion

11.18 HOW THIS UI BLUEPRINT GUIDES FOREMAN + COPILOT

Foreman can use this section to:

Validate that each module’s UI conforms to the shared patterns.

Enforce consistent wizard structure.

Reject UX proposals that break the global navigation grammar.

Instruct CoPilot exactly what components to implement where.

CoPilot can:

Generate actual React components + routing tree based on this blueprint.

Implement wizard steps with clearly defined props and state flows.

Bind components to back-end endpoints designed in the other module specs.
