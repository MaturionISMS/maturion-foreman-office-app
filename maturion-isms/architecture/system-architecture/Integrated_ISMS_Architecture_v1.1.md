# 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the high-level architecture for the Maturion Integrated Security Management System (ISMS) — the overarching ecosystem that unifies all modules, tools, AI capabilities, and user journeys within the Maturion platform.

It aligns with:

Maturion True North Architecture

Maturion Build Philosophy

Module Architecture Templates

Module QA Framework

Foreman + Builder Agent Workflow

This document provides the “big picture” of the entire system and shows how all modules interconnect.

# 2. ISMS Purpose & Vision

The ISMS is a fully integrated, AI-driven security management ecosystem designed to:

Build resilient, data-driven, loss prevention organisations

Integrate all security functions across the enterprise
