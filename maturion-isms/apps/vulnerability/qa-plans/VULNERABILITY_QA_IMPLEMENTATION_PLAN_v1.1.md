Vulnerability Module — Quality Assurance & Implementation Plan
Version: 1.1
Aligned with SRMF, Maturion True North, and One-Time Build Principles

0. PURPOSE

This document defines:

The QA blueprint for validating the Vulnerability Module

The implementation roadmap for developers & copilots

The test suite, acceptance criteria, and rollback strategy

Cross-module verification (Threat, RA, WRAC, PIT, Controls)

Watchdog, AI, and workflow governance testing

This plan ensures zero regression and 100% deterministic behaviour before the module moves to production.

1. QA PHILOSOPHY

Maturion QA follows:

1.1 Zero Regression Doctrine

No change may break any upstream or downstream module.

1.2 Deterministic Workflows

Every workflow transition is predictable & enforceable.

1.3 Dual Validation

Human validation (custodians, analysts)

AI validation (TVRE, description polish, severity assist)

1.4 Full Pipeline QA

Threat → Vulnerability → UE → RA → WRAC → PIT → Remote Assurance

1.5 Foreman Oversight

Foreman validates all milestones before merging.

2. MODULE QA SCOPE

This module touches:

Database schema

Metadata handlers
