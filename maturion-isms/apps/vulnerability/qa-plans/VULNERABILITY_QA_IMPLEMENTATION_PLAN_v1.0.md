# VULNERABILITY_QA_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v1.0.md

## Vulnerability Management - QA Implementation Plan
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-12-04

## QA Strategy
Comprehensive quality assurance covering:
- Unit testing (component & function level)
- Integration testing (API & database)
- E2E testing (user workflows)
- Security testing (auth, RLS, input validation)
- Performance testing (load & stress)
- Compliance testing (standards coverage)

## Testing Framework
- Frontend: Vitest + Testing Library
- Backend: Deno test
- E2E: Playwright
- API: Supertest / Supabase client

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests: ≥80% code coverage
- Integration tests: All API endpoints
- E2E tests: All critical user flows
- Security tests: All auth & RLS policies

## Test Categories
### Unit Tests
- Component rendering
- Form validation
- State management
- Utility functions

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint contracts
- Database operations
- RLS policy enforcement
- Event publishing/consuming

### E2E Tests
- User authentication
- CRUD operations
- Search & filter
- Form submission

## QA Governance
- All PRs require tests
- CI/CD runs all tests
- Test failures block merge
- Coverage reports generated

## Compliance Testing
- Verify audit logging
- Validate data isolation
- Check access controls
- Confirm encryption
