## Acceptance Criteria

All 7 acceptance criteria from the issue are satisfied:

- [x] ✅ Architecture spec exists and is unambiguous
- [x] ✅ Every requirement in FRS mapped to architecture components
- [x] ✅ No new scope beyond App Description + FRS
- [x] ✅ No code written
- [x] ✅ No QA suite created/executed
- [x] ✅ No builders recruited/appointed
- [x] ✅ FM explicitly confirms acceptance

---

## FM Acceptance

Foreman (FM) explicitly accepts both deliverables as complete, coherent, unambiguous, and ready to serve as binding contract for Phase 4.4 (QA-to-Red) and Phase 4.5 (Builder Recruitment).

**Date:** 2025-12-31

---

## Next Steps

**Awaiting CS2 (Johan) Acceptance**

Upon CS2 acceptance:
- Phase 4.4 (QA-to-Red Definition) may proceed
- Phase 4.5 (Builder Recruitment) remains BLOCKED until Phase 4.4 complete

## Ratchet Compliance

> We do not test what we cannot describe.  
> We do not build what we cannot trace.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT

- Architecture described completely
- All components traceable to requirements
- No testing/building ahead of architecture
