    "reasoning": "All changes are minimal, surgical, and correctly implement the required code review closure artifact validation as specified in Issue 2. The implementation: (1) defines a minimal machine-verifiable schema, (2) validates all required fields including reviewed files, findings, and final verdict, (3) enforces validation in CI as a hard gate, (4) provides clear templates and documentation, (5) follows existing patterns in the codebase, and (6) introduces no additional ceremony beyond what is necessary for governance compliance.",
