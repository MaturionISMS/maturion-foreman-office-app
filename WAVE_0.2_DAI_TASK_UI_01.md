# Delegated Action Instruction (DAI) — Wave 0.2 Task UI-01

**DAI ID:** DAI-WAVE_0.2-TASK_UI_01  
**Generated By:** Maturion Foreman (FM)  
**Date:** 2025-12-30 06:25 UTC (08:25 SAST)  
**Task ID:** WAVE_0.2_TASK_UI_01  
**Builder:** ui-builder  
**Execution Mode:** SIMULATED (Bootstrap)

---

## Action Required (CS2 Execution Proxy)

CS2 is instructed to create and merge a documentation PR for the simulated builder deliverable.

---

## 1. Context

**Task:** WAVE_0.2_TASK_UI_01 — UI Component Inventory Documentation  
**Builder:** ui-builder  
**Assigned At:** 2025-12-30 05:28 UTC  
**Completed At:** 2025-12-30 06:25 UTC (SIMULATED)  
**Execution Mode:** Bootstrap Simulation per CS2 comment 3698421579

**CS2 Corrective Instruction:**
> "Reclassify Task UI-01 as SIMULATED BUILDER EXECUTION under bootstrap. Proceed as if the ui-builder has completed the deliverable. Generate the expected deliverable content via proxy execution. Mark the task as COMPLETED (SIMULATED)."

**Rationale:** No actual builder execution occurred in bootstrap model after >50 minutes. CS2 authorized simulated execution to validate Wave 0.2 mechanics.

---

## 2. Deliverable

**File Generated:** `docs/ui/FOREMAN_UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md`  
**Size:** ~6 KB  
**Content:** Inventory of 10 planned UI components for Foreman Office App

**Deliverable Includes:**
- Foreman Dashboard

## 3. FM Validation

**Validation Status:** ✅ APPROVED (SIMULATED)

**Validation Notes:**

git add docs/ui/FOREMAN_UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md
git commit -m "[WAVE_0.2_TASK_UI_01] Add UI component inventory (SIMULATED)"
```

### Step 2: Create Pull Request

**PR Title:**
```
[Wave 0.2] Task UI-01: UI Component Inventory (SIMULATED)
```

**PR Body:**
```markdown
## Simulated Builder Execution — Wave 0.2 Task UI-01

**Execution Mode:** Bootstrap Simulation  
**Task ID:** WAVE_0.2_TASK_UI_01  
**Builder:** ui-builder (simulated)  
**Generated By:** FM via proxy execution  
**Authorization:** CS2 comment 3698421579

### Deliverable

Added: `docs/ui/FOREMAN_UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md`

Inventory of 10 planned UI components for Foreman Office App:
- Foreman Dashboard
- Task Assignment Panel
- Builder Status Display
- Evidence Viewer
- QA Results Panel
- Architecture Reference Panel
- Build Wave Progress Tracker
- Governance Compliance Dashboard
- DAI Generator Interface
- Task History Log

### Validation

- ✅ Acceptance criteria met (per WAVE_0.2_TASK_UI_01_ASSIGNMENT.md)
- ✅ Documentation-only (no code implementation)
- ✅ Valid Markdown format
- ✅ No forbidden actions
- ✅ References architecture

### Execution Context

**Simulated builder execution under Wave 0 bootstrap conditions.**

This is an intentional bootstrap simulation authorized by CS2 to validate Wave 0.2 task assignment mechanics and execution proxy flow, not a governance breach.

---

**Human bootstrap execution proxy on behalf of FM (Wave 0.2)**
```

### Step 3: Link to Issue/Branch
- Link PR to existing Wave 0.2 branch: `copilot/recruit-builders-wave-0`
- Reference issue: FM Recruitment — Batch 3B (Bootstrap)

### Step 4: Merge Pull Request

**Merge Method:** Squash and merge (preferred) or standard merge  
**Merge Commit Message:**
```
[WAVE_0.2_TASK_UI_01] UI component inventory (SIMULATED)

Simulated builder execution under Wave 0 bootstrap conditions.
Human bootstrap execution proxy on behalf of FM (Wave 0.2).
```

### Step 5: Annotate Merge

**Required Annotation in merge or comment:**
> "Simulated builder execution under Wave 0 bootstrap conditions."

## 5. Evidence

**Evidence Generated:**
1. **Deliverable:** `docs/ui/FOREMAN_UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md` ✅
2. **Task Assignment:** `WAVE_0.2_TASK_UI_01_ASSIGNMENT.md` ✅
3. **Execution Tracker:** `WAVE_0.2_EXECUTION_STATUS_TRACKER.md` (updated) ✅
4. **This DAI:** `WAVE_0.2_DAI_TASK_UI_01.md` ✅

**Traceability:**
- Task ID: WAVE_0.2_TASK_UI_01
- Builder: ui-builder
- Wave: 0.2 (Controlled Task Assignment Dry Run)
- Authorization: CS2 comment 3698421579

---

## 6. Governance Compliance

**FM Authority:**
- ✅ Generated deliverable content (authorized by CS2 corrective instruction)
- ✅ Validated acceptance criteria
- ✅ Generated DAI for CS2 proxy execution
- ✅ Updated execution tracker

**FM Did NOT:**
- ❌ Create PR directly (CS2 proxy action)
- ❌ Merge PR directly (CS2 proxy action)
- ❌ Perform GitHub platform operations (CS2 proxy required)

**CS2 Authority:**
- ✅ Authorized simulated execution (comment 3698421579)
- ✅ Acts as execution proxy for GitHub operations
- ✅ Annotates all actions as bootstrap proxy execution

**Governance Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT (authorized simulation)

---

## 7. CS2 Execution Checklist

- [ ] Commit deliverable file
- [ ] Create PR with specified title and body
- [ ] Link PR to Wave 0.2 branch
- [ ] Annotate as simulated execution
- [ ] Review PR (if desired)
- [ ] Merge PR
- [ ] Verify merge commit includes annotation
- [ ] Notify FM of completion

---

## 8. Expected Outcome

**After CS2 Execution:**
- ✅ `docs/ui/FOREMAN_UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md` merged to branch
- ✅ PR created and merged with proper annotation
- ✅ Task UI-01 validated as COMPLETED (SIMULATED)
- ✅ Evidence chain complete
- ✅ Wave 0.2 mechanics validated (task assignment, proxy flow)
- ✅ Ready to proceed with remaining tasks (or conclude Wave 0.2)

---

## 9. Notes

**Bootstrap Simulation Rationale:**

This simulation was necessary because:
1. No actual builder execution capability exists in bootstrap model
2. Task remained in ASSIGNED state for >50 minutes with no progress
3. Wave 0.2 purpose is to validate mechanics, not actual builder capability
4. CS2 explicitly authorized simulation as "intentional, not a governance breach"

**This validates:**
- ✅ Task assignment process
- ✅ Acceptance criteria definition
- ✅ FM validation process
- ✅ DAI generation
- ✅ Execution proxy protocol
- ✅ Evidence generation
