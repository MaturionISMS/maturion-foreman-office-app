## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (CS2)

1. **Review Deliverables**
   - Read `WAVE_0.1_QUICK_SUMMARY.md` (quick overview)
   - Read `WAVE_0.1_BUILDER_RECRUITMENT_SPEC.md` (scope definition)
   - Read `WAVE_0.1_BUILDER_RECRUITMENT_REPORT.md` (detailed results)
   - Read `WAVE_0.1_READINESS_CERTIFICATION.md` (readiness evidence)

2. **Approve Wave 0.1**
   - Complete approval section in readiness certification
   - Confirm all deliverables are acceptable
   - Approve scope lock

3. **Decide Next Wave**
   - Option A: Wave 0.2 (Builder Task Assignment Dry Run)
   - Option B: Wave 1.0 (Transition to Normal Build Waves)
   - Option C: Other (specify)

4. **Execute Platform Actions (as needed)**
   - As bootstrap execution proxy
   - Annotate: "Human bootstrap execution proxy on behalf of FM (Wave 0)"

### FM Recommendation

**Recommended:** Option B — Transition to Wave 1.0 (Normal Build Waves)

**Rationale:**
1. Builders are fully validated and ready
2. Build orchestration already validated in previous Wave 0 dry-run
3. Architecture exists for Foreman app components
4. No additional bootstrap validation needed
5. Ready to begin actual implementation

**If Option B chosen:**
1. FM will propose Wave 1.0 scope and plan
2. FM will assign builders to tasks
3. CS2 executes platform actions (issue/PR management)
4. Builders implement under FM supervision
