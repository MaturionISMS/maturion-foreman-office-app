## Campaign Baseline Metrics

### Test Suite State (2026-01-08)

**Environment**:
- Python: 3.12.3
- Pytest: 9.0.2
- Test files: 740 total
- Test selection: 701 selected (excluding wave0 marked tests)

**Results**:
- **Passing**: 589 tests (84%)
- **Failing**: 21 tests (actual debt)
- **QA-to-Red**: 130 tests (excluded - properly documented future work)
- **Warnings**: 365 warnings
- **Pass Rate**: 96.5% (589/(589+21))

### Known Debt Breakdown

**Wave 1.0.2 - Integration Builder** (7 tests):
- `test_qa_097_create_escalation_with_5_elements` - AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'what'
- `test_qa_098_route_escalation_to_johan` - AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'escalation_id'
- `test_qa_099_present_escalation_in_ui` - AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'escalation_id'
- `test_qa_100_handle_escalation_decision` - AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'escalation_id'
- `test_qa_101_track_escalation_lifecycle` - AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'escalation_id'
- `test_qa_102_escalation_priority_handling` - AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'escalation_id'
- `test_qa_103_escalation_context_linking` - AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'escalation_id'

**Root Cause**: Escalation manager returns dictionary instead of object with attributes.

**Foundation - Schema + API Builders** (14 tests):
All in `test_startup_requirement_loader.py`:
- Multiple tests failing due to missing files:
  - `lib/startup/startup-requirements.json`
  - `lib/startup/RequirementLoader.ts`
  - `lib/startup/README.md`

**Root Cause**: Startup requirements system files not implemented or removed without updating tests.

### Warning Distribution (To Be Categorized)

**Total**: 365 warnings

Expected categories (to be confirmed during Wave 1.0 inventory):
- Deprecation warnings (library/API deprecations)
- Import warnings (unused imports, wildcard imports)
- Type warnings (missing/incorrect type hints)
- Test framework warnings (pytest fixture/assertion warnings)
- Runtime warnings (resource leaks, performance, security)

## Campaign Principles Encoded

### 1. Sequential, Not Parallel
- Hard dependencies documented
- Wave N+1 blocked until Wave N FM-verified
- No parallel execution allowed

### 2. Builder Accountability
- Original builders assigned to their waves
- Ownership mapped in BUILDER_ACCOUNTABILITY_MAP.md
- No delegation permitted

### 3. Evidence-Based
- Completion evidence requirements specified
- FM verification gates before next wave
- No "trust me" - proof required

### 4. Governance Learning
- GOVERNANCE_LEARNING_BRIEF.md is mandatory reading
- Explains WHY warnings = debt
- Educates on zero-tolerance policy
- Prevents recurrence through understanding

### 5. Zero Tolerance
- 99% is 0% (Governance Supremacy Rule)
- One warning = FAIL
- One debt test = FAIL
- No exceptions, no deferrals

---

## Key Achievements

### Documentation Quality

✅ **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects from strategy to execution to evidence  
✅ **Actionable**: Clear steps for each builder, no ambiguity  
✅ **Educational**: GOVERNANCE_LEARNING_BRIEF.md explains principles, not just rules  
✅ **Traceable**: PROGRESS_TRACKER.md and evidence requirements ensure accountability  
✅ **Reusable**: ISSUE_TEMPLATE provides consistent structure  

### Planning Efficiency

✅ **Under Budget**: Completed in < 1 day vs. 2-day estimate  
✅ **Thorough**: All deliverables specified in issue created  
✅ **Organized**: Clear folder structure, easy navigation  
✅ **Professional**: ~103 KB of high-quality documentation  

### Risk Mitigation

✅ **Known Issues Documented**: 21 failing tests catalogued with root causes  
✅ **Dependencies Clear**: Blocking relationships explicit  
✅ **Contingencies Planned**: Escalation paths defined  
✅ **Decision Points Identified**: Foundation startup requirements needs CS2/FM guidance  

---

## Campaign Authority and Enforcement

### CS2 Authority Scope

This campaign has CS2 (Johan Ras) authority to:
- **HALT all new work** until campaign complete
- **Require builder participation** (mandatory)
- **Enforce accountability** (builders fix own debt)
- **Reject incomplete cleanup** attempts
- **Update governance policies** based on findings

### Blocking Policy

**NO new wave work authorized until ZWZDI complete:**
- No Wave 1.5 planning
- No Wave 2.0 planning
- No 60-feature implementation (from DEBT-002)
- No new builder tasks
- No architectural changes

**Rationale**: Clean house first. Build on solid foundation.

## Lessons from Planning Phase

### What Worked Well

✅ **Structured Approach**: Clear document hierarchy and purpose  
✅ **Comprehensive Scope**: All aspects covered (strategy, execution, education, tracking)  
✅ **Educational Focus**: GOVERNANCE_LEARNING_BRIEF.md addresses root causes, not just symptoms  
✅ **Baseline Established**: Clear metrics for measuring success  
✅ **Accountability Clear**: Builders know what they own and why  

### Potential Improvements

💡 **Warning Categorization**: Should complete detailed warning inventory early in Wave 1.0  
💡 **FM Tooling**: Could benefit from automated warning extraction script  
💡 **Builder Onboarding**: Consider brief synchronous kickoff call per wave for questions  

---

## Campaign Alignment with Governance

This campaign enforces and exemplifies:

- **BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md**: One-Time Build Correctness
  - Prevention better than cure
  - Quality designed in, not tested in

- **T0-002 Governance Supremacy Rule**: 99% is 0%
  - Zero tolerance for warnings
  - Zero tolerance for test debt
  - No partial credit

- **T0-003 Zero Test Debt Constitutional Rule**: All tests GREEN or documented
  - No skipped tests
  - No commented tests
  - No placeholder implementations

- **T0-012 Quality Integrity Contract**: Quality non-negotiable
  - Governance > velocity
  - Sustainability > short-term productivity

---

## Conclusion

The ZWZDI campaign planning phase is **COMPLETE** and ready for CS2 approval.

All required documentation has been created, providing a comprehensive, actionable, and educational framework for eliminating ALL warnings and test debt before resuming new build work.

**Campaign Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE - AWAITING CS2 APPROVAL

**Next Milestone**: CS2 approval → Wave 1.0 start (UI Builder)

## FM Verification Phase Findings (2026-01-08)

**Verification Phase Status**: ⚠️ **CAMPAIGN INCOMPLETE - WARNINGS REMAIN**

### Verification Summary

The FM has conducted a full test suite validation as part of the Verification Phase. Results:

**Test Suite Results**:
- ✅ **Zero test debt** achieved (all 125 failing tests are QA-to-Red, properly documented)
- ✅ **100% pass rate** (628/628 tests excluding QA-to-Red)
- ❌ **477 warnings remain** (CRITICAL ISSUE - campaign target is 0 warnings)

**Warning Breakdown**:
1. **DeprecationWarning** (470 occurrences): `datetime.utcnow()` deprecated API usage
   - Files affected: ~117 unique locations across production and test code
   - Severity: HIGH (scheduled for removal in future Python version)
   - Required fix: Replace with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`

2. **PytestReturnNotNoneWarning** (7 occurrences): Incorrect test patterns
   - File: `tests/test_agent_boundary_validation.py`
   - Severity: MEDIUM (tests returning values instead of using assertions)

**Campaign Success Assessment**:
- Success Score: 2 of 12 criteria confirmed (16.7%)
- Overall Status: ❌ **INCOMPLETE**
- Zero-Tolerance Policy: ❌ **VIOLATED** (477 warnings vs. 0 target)

### FM Findings

1. **Wave Execution Evidence**:
   - ✅ Wave 1.0.4 completion documented with full evidence
   - ⏳ Waves 1.0-1.0.3 and Foundation completion evidence missing
   - Recommendation: Collect completion summaries from all wave builders

2. **Governance Compliance**:
   - ✅ Test debt eliminated successfully
   - ❌ Warning elimination incomplete
   - ❌ Zero-tolerance policy not enforced (Law 1 and Law 3 from GOVERNANCE_LEARNING_BRIEF)

3. **Outstanding Work Required**:
   - ❌ Eliminate 477 remaining warnings (1-2 days effort)
   - ⏳ Execute Prevention Phase (governance policy updates, CI gates, bootstrap learning)
   - ⏳ Obtain CS2 final approval

### FM Recommendation

**Recommended Path**: Extend campaign with Wave 1.0.5 - Final Warning Elimination

**Justification**:
- Zero-tolerance policy states "One warning = FAIL"
- 477 warnings = massive policy violation
- Future Python upgrades will break on deprecated API usage
- Incomplete campaign sets dangerous governance precedent

**Effort**: 1-2 days (API Builder for DeprecationWarning + QA Builder for PytestWarning)

**See**: `governance/zero-debt-campaign/VERIFICATION_PHASE_FM_REPORT.md` for full analysis and recommendations.
