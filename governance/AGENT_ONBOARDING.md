# Agent Onboarding

**Status**: Active  
**Authority**: CS2 (Agent Contract Minimalism Framework)  
**Date**: 2026-01-08

---

## Quick Start

**All agents start here**:

Read **AGENT_ONBOARDING_QUICKSTART.md** in the governance repository:  
https://github.com/APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance/blob/main/governance/canon/AGENT_ONBOARDING_QUICKSTART.md

This provides:
- Your role and authority boundaries
- Essential canonical governance references
- 3-step operational protocol
- Escalation rules
- Mandatory compliance requirements

---

## Then Read Your Contract

After reading the quickstart, read your `.agent` contract in `.github/agents/[your-agent].md`

Your contract is minimal (150-300 lines) and references canonical governance via `governance.bindings`.

## Questions?

**For operational questions**: Escalate to FM (ForemanApp-agent)  
**For governance questions**: Escalate to Governance Liaison  
**For constitutional questions**: Escalate to CS2 (Johan Ras)

## Canonical Governance Location

All canonical governance lives in the **maturion-foreman-governance** repository:
- Repository: https://github.com/APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance
- Path: `/governance/canon/`
- Reference Branch: `main`

Your agent contract `governance.bindings` section specifies which canonical documents apply to your role.
