# FM AUTONOMY GOVERNANCE CORRECTION SUMMARY

## Status
**Type**: Governance Correction Report  
**Date**: 2026-01-01  
**Authority**: Governance Correction Initiative  
**Issue Reference**: #[ISSUE_NUMBER] — FM Autonomy & One-Time Build Alignment  
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL — SYSTEMIC DRIFT CORRECTION

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the **completion** of a comprehensive governance correction cycle to address systemic drift in FM autonomy and One-Time Build execution semantics.

**Problem**: Historical governance drift allowed AI agents to reinterpret FM authority and introduce coder-centric execution models, violating One-Time Build law.

**Root Cause**: Distributed canon + implicit semantics across multiple documents without a single binding reference.

**Resolution**: Created binding governance artifacts that make FM autonomy and One-Time Build execution **explicit, non-interpretable, and constitutionally enforceable**.

**Outcome**: FM sovereignty and autonomous execution are now **unambiguous** and **binding**.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Intent Reconciliation (NO NEW CANON)

✅ **Created**: `governance/tech-surveys/TSP_03_FM_AUTONOMY_AND_ONE_TIME_BUILD_INTENT_SURVEY.md`

**Purpose**: Authoritative reconciliation index proving that FM sovereignty and One-Time Build are **already defined** in existing governance.

**Key Findings**:
- FM sovereignty is explicitly defined in `foreman/identity.md`, `foreman/roles-and-duties.md`, and agent contracts
- One-Time Build law is constitutional law, defined in multiple canonical documents
- Bootstrap proxy semantics are defined in `BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md` (BL-0004)
- Drift was caused by **distribution + implicit phrasing**, not missing intent
- GitHub constraints were incorrectly treated as authority constraints

**Outcome**: No new philosophical canon created; survey **binds existing intent** only.

---

### 2. Governance Layer-Down (BINDING)

✅ **Created**: `governance/build/FM_AUTONOMY_BINDING_CHECKLIST.md`

**Purpose**: Binding governance artifact that makes FM autonomy and One-Time Build execution **explicit and non-interpretable**.

**Content**:
- **Section 3**: Mandatory FM Authorities (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
  - Build orchestration authority
  - Builder coordination authority
  - Architecture governance authority
  - QA governance authority
  - Integration governance authority
  - Merge and delivery authority
  
- **Section 4**: Mandatory FM Execution Semantics (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
  - Autonomous execution (no stepwise approval)
  - Sandbox execution
  - One-Time Build law
  - Build-to-Green law
  - Human interaction model (final UI evaluation only)
  
- **Section 5**: Bootstrap Proxy Exception (TEMPORARY)
  - Bootstrap proxy is execution infrastructure, NOT approval authority
  - Human proxy executes mechanically without review or validation
  - FM retains full decision authority
  
- **Section 6**: GitHub Constraints Are Not Authority Constraints
  - GitHub limitations are tooling constraints, not authority constraints
  - Authority vs. execution separation clarified
  
- **Section 7**: Enforcement Checklist
  - Pre-build validation
  - Execution validation
  - Bootstrap proxy validation (if active)
  - Post-build validation
  
- **Section 8**: Violation Escalation
  - Examples of violations
  - Escalation procedure

**Outcome**: FM autonomy is now **constitutionally binding** and **enforceable**.

---

### 3. Platform Readiness Alignment

✅ **Updated**: `governance/canon/PLATFORM_READINESS_FOR_GOVERNED_BUILD_EXECUTION.md` (v2.1.0)

**Changes**:
- **Section 15** (NEW): FM Autonomous Execution and Bootstrap Proxy Clarification
  - Platform readiness assumes fully autonomous FM execution
  - GitHub constraints are tooling limits, not authority limits
  - Bootstrap proxy does NOT redefine authority
  - Bootstrap proxy vs. coder ethics distinction made explicit
  - Human role limited to final UI evaluation
  - Integration with existing readiness conditions
  
- **Section 16** (NEW): Bootstrap Execution Learnings Integration
  - Records historical drift
  - Documents prevention measures
  - Establishes requirements for future readiness declarations
  
- **Updated**: Section 4.3 (Agent Contracts) extended with autonomous execution requirements
  - FM contract must document sovereign authority
  - FM contract must forbid coder-style approval loops
  - FM contract must limit human role to final UI evaluation
  - FM contract must clarify GitHub constraints as tooling limits
  
- **Version**: Updated from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0

**Outcome**: Platform readiness now **explicitly requires** autonomous FM execution.

---

### 4. FM Agent Contract Update

✅ **Updated**: `governance/agents/foreman-office.agent.contract.md` (v2)

**Changes**:
- **New Section**: Sovereign Execution Authority (EXPLICIT)
  - Mandatory authorities enumerated (build orchestration, builder coordination, architecture governance, QA governance, integration governance, merge authority)
  - Execution semantics made binding (autonomous execution, One-Time Build law, Build-to-Green law, sandbox execution, human role limitation)
  - Explicitly forbidden actions listed (stepwise approval, coder-style workflows, human validation loops, iterative correction)
  
- **New Section**: GitHub Constraints Clarification
  - GitHub limitation vs. authority clarification
  - Authority vs. execution mechanism separation table
  
- **New Section**: Bootstrap Proxy Semantics (BINDING)
  - Bootstrap proxy rules enumerated
  - FM retains full authority
  - Human proxy executes mechanically only
  - Bootstrap proxy vs. coder ethics distinction
  - Bootstrap proxy termination conditions
  
- **Updated**: Authority section expanded with sovereign execution authority
- **Updated**: Non-negotiables section includes autonomous execution
- **New Section**: Governance Binding references
  - Links to FM_AUTONOMY_BINDING_CHECKLIST.md
  - Links to PLATFORM_READINESS_FOR_GOVERNED_BUILD_EXECUTION.md
  - Links to TSP_03 survey
  - Links to BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md
  
- **New Section**: Escalation and Human Authority
  - FM subordinate to human authority (Johan)
  - Escalation triggers enumerated
  - Human authority supremacy documented
  
- **Version**: Updated from v1 to v2

**Outcome**: FM agent contract now **explicitly** documents sovereign authority and autonomous execution requirements.

---

### 5. Lessons Learned

✅ **Updated**: `governance/canon/BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md` (Added BL-016)

**New Learning**: BL-016 — FM Autonomy Drift: Distributed Canon + Implicit Semantics

**Content**:
- **Context**: AI agents reverted to coder-centric execution models during live execution
- **Observed Issue**: Bootstrap proxy misinterpreted as authority transfer; stepwise approval loops introduced
- **Root Cause**: Distributed canon + implicit semantics; no binding reference
- **Learning**: Distributed governance intent requires binding artifacts to prevent reinterpretation
- **Impact**: Execution halted due to governance misinterpretation
- **Governance Action Taken**: Created TSP_03, FM_AUTONOMY_BINDING_CHECKLIST, updated PLATFORM_READINESS, updated FM agent contract
- **Prevention**: Validator checklist for future builds
- **Ratchet Statement**: This failure is accepted **once**; distributed governance intent is insufficient; binding artifacts are mandatory
- **Related Artifacts**: Links to all created/updated governance artifacts
- **Status**: Recorded — Non-Retroactive; Applies to all future governed builds; Effective 2026-01-01

**Outcome**: Drift cause and resolution formally recorded as a constitutional learning.
