# Versioning Rules

v0.1 → draft  
v0.2 → corrections  
v1.0 → final build-ready  
v1.1 → enhancement  
v2.0 → major redesign  

Rules:
- Major version increments require Foreman review + Johan approval.
- Minor increments require Foreman approval.
- Drafts must NOT be used for building.

## Memory Integration

All version changes must be recorded in the Memory Fabric:
- Major version increments must document rationale in memory
- Breaking changes must reference memory entries
- Version history feeds into architectural memory
- Memory Fabric itself follows versioning rules
