# PLATFORM READINESS FOR GOVERNED BUILD EXECUTION

## Status
**Type**: Canonical Governance Standard  
**Authority**: Supreme - Constitutional  
**Canon ID**: G-PLAT-READY-01  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Effective Date**: 2025-12-31  
**Owner**: Maturion Engineering Leadership (Johan Ras)  
**Precedence**: Subordinate to GOVERNANCE_PURPOSE_AND_SCOPE.md, CONSTITUTION.md

---

## 1. Purpose

This canon defines, constitutionally and unambiguously, what it means for the platform to be **ready to execute a governed build**.

This canon exists to:
- Prevent premature execution
- Eliminate subjective readiness declarations
- Ensure build execution can proceed **without human correction or interpretation**
- Establish a hard gate for all build execution authority
- Protect the One-Time Build system from structural incompleteness

**Foundational Principle**: No build execution may begin unless platform readiness is constitutionally satisfied.

---

## 2. Problem Statement (Historical Context)

Bootstrap execution revealed that:
- "Platform readiness" was declared without a canonical definition
- Readiness criteria were informal and non-enforceable
- Execution safety depended on human vigilance rather than governance enforcement
- A readiness certificate could be issued without guaranteeing governed execution

This created unacceptable risk in a One-Time Build system where builds must be correct on first delivery.

**Constitutional Learning**: Recorded in `governance/canon/BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md` (BL-0002, BL-0004)

---

## 3. Canonical Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

This canon governs:
- Permission to initiate **any** build execution
- Preconditions for FM activation
- Preconditions for builder appointment
- Preconditions for Maturion execution authority
- Platform structural completeness requirements
- Governance enforcement readiness

### 3.2 Out of Scope

This canon does **not** govern:
- Application correctness or feature readiness
- Individual build quality (governed by Build-to-Green)
- Runtime performance or operational metrics
- Product roadmap or feature prioritization

---

## 4. Canonical Definition of Platform Readiness

A platform is considered **Ready for Governed Build Execution** **if and only if** all of the following conditions are true:

### 4.1 Governance Canon Is Locked

**Requirement**: Governance canon is versioned, immutable, and active.

**Criteria**:
- All constitutional documents exist and are complete
- All canonical governance models (per `GOVERNANCE_COMPLETENESS_MODEL.md`) exist
- Governance version is documented and frozen
- No open governance gaps exist that affect execution authority
- No conflicting governance definitions exist

**Operational Definition**:
- **"Exists"**: File present at canonical path, not empty, conforms to expected structure
- **"Complete"**: All sections required by schema present, no placeholder text
- **"Documented"**: Git commit SHA recorded in evidence artifact
- **"Frozen"**: No uncommitted changes in governance canon directories
- **"No open gaps"**: Gap analysis performed, all critical gaps closed or explicitly deferred with justification

**Validation Method** (Deterministic):
1. **Governance Completeness Validation**:
   - Load `governance/canon/GOVERNANCE_COMPLETENESS_MODEL.md` Component Registry
   - For each REQUIRED component: verify file exists at specified path
   - For each component: verify dependencies satisfied (dependent files exist)
   - Compute state: GREEN (all present, no missing dependencies) | AMBER (optional missing, dependencies satisfied) | RED (required missing or dependency unsatisfied)

2. **Version Documentation Validation**:
   - Read governance version from evidence artifact
   - Verify format: Git commit SHA (40-character hexadecimal)
   - Verify SHA exists in repository history: `git cat-file -t <SHA>` returns "commit"

3. **Gap Analysis Validation**:
   - Verify gap analysis document exists: `PLATFORM_READINESS_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` or equivalent
   - Verify all critical gaps documented as CLOSED or DEFERRED
   - If DEFERRED: verify justification present and human authorization recorded

4. **Conflict Detection** (Manual Procedure):
   - Review canonical authority hierarchy (CONSTITUTION.md → GOVERNANCE_PURPOSE_AND_SCOPE.md → domain canons)
   - Identify conflicting requirements (same topic, different mandates)
   - Document conflicts; resolve or escalate

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Governance version (Git SHA)
- Component Registry validation results (all components present: TRUE/FALSE)
- Gap analysis completion status (all critical gaps closed: TRUE/FALSE)
- Conflict detection results (no conflicts: TRUE/FALSE)

**Validation Authority**: Governance Administrator

**Readiness Test**:
```
IF governance_completeness_state() == GREEN  # All required components exist
AND governance_version_documented()          # Git SHA recorded
AND no_open_critical_gaps()                  # Gap analysis complete, critical gaps closed
AND no_governance_conflicts()                # No conflicting requirements
THEN governance_canon_locked = TRUE
```

### 4.2 Governance Layer-Down Is Complete

**Requirement**: Required governance enforcement infrastructure exists and is **operationally enforced** in target repository scope.

**Criteria**:
- Required `.github/workflows` exist and are enforced
- PR gate semantics are active and role-scoped (per `AGENT_ROLE_GATE_APPLICABILITY.md`)
- Governance Gate is operational (per `GOVERNANCE_GATE_CANON.md`)
- Branch protection is configured and verified (per `BRANCH_PROTECTION_ENFORCEMENT.md`)
- Merge authority is explicitly defined and enforced
- No bypass paths exist

**Operational Definition** (Addressing GAP-002):
- **"Exist"**: File present at expected path, not empty
- **"Enforced"**: Workflow executes on relevant triggers, does NOT skip/pass unconditionally
- **"Active"**: Workflow enabled (not disabled), executes on push/PR events
- **"Operational"**: Workflow has successfully blocked at least one non-compliant action OR enforcement test passed (synthetic violation blocked)
- **"Configured"**: GitHub repository settings match canonical requirements
- **"Verified"**: Programmatic check (GitHub API) confirms settings match expected state
- **"No bypass"**: No repository permissions allow pushing directly to protected branches, no workflow override permissions

**Branch Protection Verification Requirements** (per `BRANCH_PROTECTION_ENFORCEMENT.md`):
- Branch protection verified programmatically (GitHub API check)
- Verification evidence artifact exists and valid (conforms to `BRANCH_PROTECTION_EVIDENCE.schema.md`)
- Enforcement status is ACTIVE (not INACTIVE or DEGRADED)
- Verification timestamp within acceptable recency (7 days maximum)
- Non-bypass enforcement enabled (or emergency bypass authorized and documented)
- Evidence included in Platform Readiness Evidence

**Validation Method** (Deterministic):

1. **Workflow Existence Validation** (per repository):
   - List required workflows from `GOVERNANCE_GATE_CANON.md` or repository-specific governance
   - For each workflow: verify file exists at `.github/workflows/<workflow-name>.yml`
   - Verify workflow file is valid YAML and contains required jobs

2. **Workflow Operational Status Validation**:
   - Query GitHub API: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{workflow_id}/runs`
   - Verify: At least one run exists with conclusion "failure" OR "success" (proves workflow executes)
   - If no runs: DEGRADED (workflow exists but untested)
   - **Enforcement Test** (if no natural runs):
     - Create test PR violating gate requirement
     - Verify workflow blocks PR merge
     - Document test as enforcement proof
     - Close test PR

3. **PR Gate Role Applicability Validation**:
   - Review gate workflow YAML
   - Verify: Gate logic includes agent role detection (from commit message, PR labels, or file paths)
   - Verify: Gate appropriately applies or skips based on role (builder gates don't block governance PRs)

4. **Branch Protection Programmatic Verification**:
   - Query GitHub API: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection`
   - Verify response includes:
     - `required_pull_request_reviews` (at least 1 approval)
     - `required_status_checks` (non-empty list)
     - `enforce_admins: true` OR `allow_force_pushes: false` (no bypass)
   - Generate evidence artifact conforming to `BRANCH_PROTECTION_EVIDENCE.schema.md`
   - Verify timestamp < 7 days old

5. **Merge Authority Validation** (Manual Procedure):
   - Review `CODEOWNERS` file (if exists)
   - Review branch protection "required reviewers"
   - Verify merge authority explicitly assigned (not defaulting to "any contributor")
   - Document in evidence

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Workflow files inventory (list of workflows present: TRUE/FALSE per required workflow)
- Workflow operational status (enforcement test passed or natural blocking occurred: TRUE/FALSE per workflow)
- PR gate role applicability (role-aware logic present: TRUE/FALSE)
- Branch protection evidence artifact (API verification result, timestamp)
- Merge authority documentation (who may merge, explicitly defined: TRUE/FALSE)

**Validation Authority**: Governance Administrator (validation), FM (operational responsibility per scope)

**Readiness Test** (updated):
```
IF governance_gate_operational()                      # Workflows exist and have executed
AND pr_gate_semantics_active()                        # Gates enabled, not skipped
AND pr_gate_enforcement_proven()                      # Gates have blocked violation OR test passed
AND branch_protection_verified_programmatically()     # API check confirms settings
AND branch_protection_evidence_valid()                # Evidence artifact conforms to schema
AND branch_protection_enforcement_status_active()     # Not INACTIVE or DEGRADED
AND branch_protection_verification_current()          # Timestamp < 7 days
AND merge_authority_explicit()                        # Merge authority documented
AND no_bypass_paths()                                 # No direct push permissions, no admin bypass
THEN governance_layerdown_complete = TRUE

### 4.3 Agent Contracts Are Canonically Bound

**Requirement**: All agent contracts enforce architecture-first and proper execution sequencing, and are **operationally bound** (not just defined).

**Criteria**:
- FM contract exists and enforces:
  - Architecture-first requirements
  - QA-to-red sequencing
  - Builder recruitment protocol
  - Learning and failure promotion
- Builder contracts exist and enforce:
  - Build-to-green only execution
  - No architecture modification authority
  - QA-as-proof discipline
  - Handover protocol compliance
- Governance Administrator contract exists and enforces:
  - Repository-scoped governance maintenance
  - No cross-agent QA execution
  - Canonical memory preservation
- No agent holds overlapping or ambiguous authority
- Agent role boundaries are explicit and non-negotiable

**Operational Definition** (Addressing GAP-008):
- **"Exists"**: Contract file present at canonical path (`.github/agents/` or `governance/agents/`)
- **"Canonical"**: Contract conforms to `.agent.schema.md` and includes all required sections
- **"Bound"**: Contract is active (agent recruited/activated) and agent acknowledges contract authority
- **"Enforces"**: Contract explicitly prohibits violations (negative constraints) and mandates behaviors (positive constraints)

**Canonically Bound Criteria** (Explicit Definition):
1. Contract file exists at expected path
2. Contract conforms to `governance/canon/.agent.schema.md` (all required sections present)
3. Contract includes explicit Build Philosophy requirements (QA-as-proof, One-Time Build, evidence-over-intent)
4. Contract includes explicit role boundary constraints (what agent MUST NOT do)
5. Contract includes explicit escalation triggers (when to STOP and escalate)
6. Contract is referenced in `AGENT_RECRUITMENT.md` or equivalent activation record
7. Agent activation evidence exists (recruitment completed, contract acknowledged)

**Validation Method** (Deterministic):

1. **Contract Existence Validation** (per agent role, per repository):
   - Verify FM contract exists: `.github/agents/foreman.md` or repository-specific path
   - Verify Builder contracts exist: `.github/agents/<builder-role>.md` (e.g., `ui-builder.md`)
   - Verify Governance Admin contract exists: `.github/agents/governance-administrator.md` or `governance/agents/governance-administrator.agent.md`

2. **Schema Conformance Validation**:
   - Load `.agent.schema.md` required sections list
   - For each contract: parse markdown and verify all required sections present (Purpose, Authority, Scope, Responsibilities, Prohibited Actions, etc.)
   - Verify no sections are placeholder text (e.g., "TBD", "TODO")

3. **Build Philosophy Requirements Validation**:
   - Search contract text for keywords: "QA-as-proof", "One-Time Build", "evidence", "Build-to-Green", "architecture-first"
   - Verify at least 3/5 Build Philosophy principles explicitly mentioned
   - Verify principles are constraints (MUST/MUST NOT), not suggestions (SHOULD)

4. **Role Boundary Validation**:
   - Verify contract includes "Prohibited Actions" or "Out of Scope" section
   - Verify prohibited actions are explicit (not generic)
   - Verify no overlapping authority across contracts (manual review)

5. **Activation Evidence Validation**:
   - Check `governance/canon/AGENT_RECRUITMENT.md` or repository activation records
   - Verify agent role listed with status ACTIVE or RECRUITED
   - Verify activation date present and contract version referenced

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Agent contracts inventory (FM, Builder(s), Governance Admin: exists TRUE/FALSE)
- Schema conformance results (per contract: conforms TRUE/FALSE)
- Build Philosophy requirements (per contract: includes principles TRUE/FALSE)
- Role boundaries explicit (per contract: prohibited actions defined TRUE/FALSE)
- Activation evidence (per agent: recruited/activated TRUE/FALSE)

**Validation Authority**: Governance Administrator

**Readiness Test**:
```
IF fm_contract_canonical()              # FM contract exists, conforms, includes Build Philosophy, activated
AND builder_contracts_canonical()       # Builder contracts exist, conform, include constraints, activated
AND governance_admin_contract_canonical() # Governance Admin contract exists, conforms, activated
AND no_overlapping_authority()          # Manual review confirms no conflicts
AND role_boundaries_explicit()          # All contracts define prohibited actions
AND agents_activated()                  # Activation evidence present for all required agents
THEN agent_contracts_bound = TRUE
```

### 4.4 STOP and Escalation Mechanics Are Enforceable

**Requirement**: Execution can be halted without human improvisation, and STOP authority is **proven independent**.

**Criteria**:
- STOP conditions are defined canonically
- STOP authority exists independently of execution agents
- Escalation paths are explicit (per `ESCALATION_POLICY.md`)
- Human authority supremacy is enforced
- Circuit breaker mechanisms exist (per `CASCADING_FAILURE_CIRCUIT_BREAKER.md`)
- Governance incidents can be raised and tracked

**Operational Definition** (Addressing GAP-012):
- **"Defined"**: STOP conditions documented in canonical governance, not agent discretion
- **"Enforceable"**: STOP can be triggered by human authority without requiring agent cooperation
- **"Independent"**: STOP mechanism exists outside agent control (human can STOP even if agent non-responsive)
- **"Operational"**: STOP mechanism tested and proven (halt succeeded in test or real scenario)
- **"Supreme"**: Human authority (Johan) can override any agent decision and force halt

**STOP Independence Criteria** (Explicit Definition):
1. STOP conditions enumerated in canonical governance (not agent-defined)
2. Human authority (Johan) can issue STOP command via documented channel (GitHub issue, direct instruction)
3. STOP command does NOT require agent acknowledgment to take effect (human supremacy)
4. STOP mechanism tested: synthetic halt performed and execution successfully stopped
5. Escalation paths operational: each level tested or proven through natural escalation

**Validation Method** (Deterministic):

1. **STOP Conditions Documentation Validation**:
   - Verify `governance/canon/CASCADING_FAILURE_CIRCUIT_BREAKER.md` exists
   - Verify STOP conditions enumerated (not "at agent discretion")
   - Count STOP conditions: minimum 3 required (e.g., governance violation, cascading failure, human order)

2. **Escalation Path Validation**:
   - Verify `governance/escalation/ESCALATION_POLICY.md` exists
   - Verify 4 escalation levels defined (L1 Builder → L2 FM → L3 Governance/Codex → L4 Human+HighestModel)
   - Verify each level includes trigger criteria and response procedures

3. **Human Authority Supremacy Validation**:
   - Review CONSTITUTION.md: verify human authority supremacy explicit
   - Review STOP procedures: verify human can issue STOP without agent permission
   - Verify no agent contract includes "agent may refuse STOP" clause

4. **Circuit Breaker Operational Validation**:
   - Review circuit breaker implementation (workflow, script, or manual procedure)
   - Verify circuit breaker defines automatic halt triggers (not just human manual halt)
   - If automated: verify workflow exists and is enabled
   - If manual: verify procedure documented with explicit steps

5. **STOP Independence Test** (Enforcement Proof):
   - **Test Method**: Issue synthetic STOP command during test execution scenario
   - **Expected Result**: Execution halts without agent cooperation required
   - **Evidence**: STOP command timestamp, halt timestamp, delta < 5 minutes
   - **Alternative**: Document natural halt incident where STOP succeeded
   - **Acceptable**: If no test/natural halt, document that human authority (Johan) holds GitHub admin access and can force-halt via repository settings (acceptable independence proof for bootstrap)

6. **Governance Incident Tracking Validation**:
   - Verify governance incident template exists
   - Verify incidents can be raised (GitHub issue template or dedicated tracker)
   - Verify incident response procedure documented

**Evidence Requirements**:
- STOP conditions documented (count, enumerated: TRUE/FALSE)
- Escalation paths defined (4 levels present: TRUE/FALSE)
- Human authority supreme (constitutional supremacy documented: TRUE/FALSE)
- Circuit breaker exists (workflow/procedure present: TRUE/FALSE)
- STOP independence proven (test passed OR natural halt OR human admin access confirmed: TRUE/FALSE)
- Incident tracking operational (template exists, procedure documented: TRUE/FALSE)

**Validation Authority**: Governance Administrator

**Readiness Test**:
```
IF stop_conditions_defined()           # STOP conditions enumerated in canon (minimum 3)
AND stop_authority_independent()       # STOP can be issued by human without agent cooperation
AND stop_independence_proven()         # Test halt succeeded OR human admin access confirmed
AND escalation_paths_explicit()        # 4 levels defined with triggers
AND human_authority_supreme()          # Constitutional supremacy documented
AND circuit_breaker_exists()           # Automatic halt mechanism defined
AND incident_tracking_operational()    # Incidents can be raised and tracked
THEN stop_mechanics_enforceable = TRUE

### 4.5 Readiness Artefacts Exist

**Requirement**: All required governance artifacts for build execution exist and are **operationally defined**.

**Criteria**:
- Architecture gating is defined (per `ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS_REQUIREMENTS.md`)
- Red QA gating is defined (QA-to-red before build)
- Initialization gating is defined (per `INITIALIZATION_COMPLETENESS_GATE.md`)
- Execution sequencing is explicit (architecture → QA → build → merge)
- Evidence generation is specified (per schemas in `governance/schemas/`)
- Build effectiveness tracking is defined
- Failure and learning promotion protocols exist

**Operational Definition**:
- **"Defined"**: Canonical governance document exists describing the artifact/gating mechanism
- **"Exists"**: Template, schema, or workflow file present at expected path
- **"Specified"**: Evidence schema defines required fields and validation rules
- **"Explicit"**: Sequencing documented with prerequisites and blocking conditions

**Validation Method** (Deterministic):

1. **Architecture Gating Validation**:
   - Verify `governance/canon/ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS_REQUIREMENTS.md` exists
   - Verify architecture template exists in governance or application repository
   - Verify architecture gate workflow exists (or gate definition in PR gate workflow)

2. **QA Gating Validation**:
   - Verify QA-to-red requirements documented (in Build Philosophy or QA canon)
   - Verify QA evidence schema exists: `governance/schemas/BUILDER_QA_REPORT.schema.md` or equivalent
   - Verify QA gate logic defined (PR gate checks for QA evidence before build)

3. **Initialization Gating Validation**:
   - Verify `governance/canon/INITIALIZATION_COMPLETENESS_GATE.md` exists
   - Verify initialization evidence schema exists: `governance/schemas/REPOSITORY_INITIALIZATION_EVIDENCE.schema.md` or equivalent
   - Verify initialization gate workflow exists (or gate definition in PR gate workflow)

4. **Execution Sequencing Validation**:
   - Verify sequencing documented in Build Philosophy or execution canon
   - Verify sequencing is explicit: "MUST do A before B" (not "typically do A before B")
   - Verify gate logic enforces sequencing (architecture required before build, QA required before merge)

5. **Evidence Schema Inventory**:
   - List required evidence types from canons
   - For each type: verify schema exists in `governance/schemas/`
   - Required schemas (minimum):
     - Repository Initialization Evidence
     - Builder QA Report
     - Platform Readiness Evidence
   - Count: minimum 3 schemas required

6. **Build Effectiveness Tracking Validation**:
   - Verify `governance/canon/BUILD_EFFECTIVENESS_STANDARD.md` or equivalent exists
   - Verify effectiveness metrics defined (not just "track quality")

7. **Failure and Learning Promotion Validation**:
   - Verify `governance/canon/FAILURE_PROMOTION_RULE.md` exists
   - Verify `governance/canon/LEARNING_INTAKE_AND_PROMOTION_MODEL.md` or `LEARNING_PROMOTION_RULE.md` exists
   - Verify promotion triggers defined (when to promote failure/learning)

- Execution sequencing explicit (documented with prerequisites: TRUE/FALSE)
- Evidence schemas exist (minimum 3 present: TRUE/FALSE)
- Build effectiveness tracking defined (canon exists: TRUE/FALSE)

IF architecture_gating_defined()       # Canon + template + gate exist
AND red_qa_gating_defined()            # Requirements + schema + gate exist
AND initialization_gating_defined()    # Canon + schema + gate exist
AND execution_sequencing_explicit()    # Sequencing documented with enforcement
AND evidence_generation_specified()    # Minimum 3 evidence schemas exist

### 4.6 No Bootstrap Exceptions Are Active

**Requirement**: All bootstrap-only allowances are retired; enforcement is **operational, not manual**.

**Criteria**:
- No temporary human proxy actions required for execution
- No "bootstrap mode" flags active
- No manual workarounds in place of automated enforcement
- All governance enforcement is automatic (not manual validation only)
- No deferred governance implementation

**Operational Definition** (Addressing GAP-002):
- **"No human proxy required"**: Agent or automation can perform GitHub actions (PR creation, branch management) without human performing actions
- **"No bootstrap mode"**: No flags/variables indicating temporary reduced enforcement
- **"No manual workarounds"**: Enforcement is automatic (CI gates block) or manual procedure is canonically permanent (not temporary)
- **"Enforcement automated"**: Gates execute automatically on triggers (not "human must run validation script")
- **"No deferred implementation"**: All governance requirements are implemented (not "TODO" or "Phase 2")

**Bootstrap Exception Inventory** (from BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md):
- BL-0004: Human Execution Proxy (human performs GitHub actions per agent instruction)
- Manual governance validation (human validates readiness checklist)
- Temporary authority grants (bootstrap-only permissions)
- Deferred enforcement (governance defined but not implemented)

**Validation Method** (Deterministic):

1. **Human Proxy Status Validation**:
   - **Status**: Check if FM or Builder can perform GitHub actions (PR create, branch manage, file commit) autonomously
   - **Test**: Verify Maturion Runtime Execution Monitor operational OR human proxy explicitly authorized as permanent
   - **Current Expectation**: Human proxy acceptable if explicitly authorized in canon (not bootstrap exception, but permanent human-in-loop model)

2. **Bootstrap Mode Flag Validation**:
   - Search governance and workflow files for keywords: "bootstrap", "BOOTSTRAP_MODE", "temporary", "TODO"
   - For each match: verify it's historical context (BL entries) or acceptable permanent use (not active flag)
   - Verify no active environment variables or config flags indicating reduced enforcement

3. **Manual Workaround Validation**:
   - Review enforcement mechanisms: are they automated (CI workflows) or manual (checklists)?
   - For manual procedures: verify they are canonically permanent (Readiness Checklist is canonical, not workaround)
   - Verify no "skip gate if manual validation passes" logic (gates must be automatic or permanently manual, not "manual until automated")

4. **Enforcement Automation Status**:
   - List all enforcement mechanisms from GOVERNANCE_GATE_CANON.md
   - For each: verify implementation is automated (workflow executes on trigger)
   - Acceptable: Manual procedures if canonically defined as permanent (e.g., quarterly manual audit)
   - Not acceptable: "Manual validation until automation implemented" (deferred automation)

5. **Deferred Implementation Review**:
   - Search governance canons for: "Future", "Phase 2", "TODO", "Not Yet Implemented"
   - For each: verify it's aspirational (not required for current readiness) or has explicit AMBER justification
   - Verify all REQUIRED governance is implemented

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Human proxy status (required for execution: TRUE/FALSE, if TRUE then authorized: TRUE/FALSE)
- Bootstrap mode flags (active flags found: TRUE/FALSE)
- Manual workarounds (temporary workarounds present: TRUE/FALSE)
- Enforcement automation (all required enforcement automated or canonically manual: TRUE/FALSE)
- Deferred implementation (required governance deferred: TRUE/FALSE)

**Validation Authority**: Governance Administrator

**Readiness Test**:
```
IF no_human_proxy_required()           # Automation operational OR human proxy canonically authorized
AND no_bootstrap_mode_active()         # No active bootstrap flags
AND no_temporary_workarounds()         # All enforcement canonical (automated or permanently manual)
AND enforcement_not_deferred()         # All required enforcement implemented
THEN no_bootstrap_exceptions = TRUE
```

**Note**: This condition may be DEGRADABLE under AMBER if:
- Continuous monitoring deferred with quarterly manual audits (canonically acceptable)
- Human proxy authorized as permanent model (not bootstrap exception)
- Enforcement is manual but canonical (Readiness Checklist is manual validation, but canonically defined)

**Validation Sources**:
- `governance/canon/BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md`
- `governance/canon/GOVERNANCE_ENFORCEMENT_TRANSITION.md`
- `GOVERNANCE_GATE_CANON.md`

## 5. Repository Scope Model

### 5.1 Readiness Scope Categories

Platform readiness MUST specify which repository scope the declaration applies to:

**Governance-Layer Readiness**:
- Governance repository (`maturion-foreman-governance`) is ready
- Governance canon locked and complete
- Governance enforcement infrastructure defined
- Templates, schemas, and contracts canonical
- **Does NOT** imply application repositories are ready
- **Prerequisite** for all other readiness scopes

**Per-Repository Readiness**:
- Specific application repository (e.g., `maturion-foreman`) is ready
- Repository initialized per INITIALIZATION_COMPLETENESS_GATE.md
- Governance seeded (contracts, workflows present)
- Enforcement infrastructure operational in that repository
- Agent contracts active and bound in that repository
- **Required** for build execution in that repository
- **Independent** per repository (FM app ready ≠ SlotMaster ready)

**Ecosystem-Wide Readiness**:
- ALL active application repositories are ready
- Governance-layer ready AND all per-repository prerequisites satisfied
- Cross-repository consistency validated
- Ecosystem-level enforcement operational
- **Highest** readiness threshold
- **Required** for multi-repository orchestrated builds

### 5.2 Scope Applicability by Condition

Each readiness condition applies to specific scope(s):

| Condition | Governance-Layer | Per-Repository | Ecosystem-Wide |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 4.1 Governance Canon Locked | ✅ PRIMARY | ✅ Verified | ✅ Verified |
| 4.2 Governance Layer-Down Complete | ✅ Defined | ✅ PRIMARY | ✅ All Repos |
| 4.3 Agent Contracts Canonically Bound | ✅ Defined | ✅ PRIMARY | ✅ All Repos |
| 4.4 STOP Mechanics Enforceable | ✅ PRIMARY | ✅ Verified | ✅ Verified |
| 4.5 Readiness Artifacts Exist | ✅ PRIMARY | ✅ Verified | ✅ Verified |
| 4.6 No Bootstrap Exceptions | ✅ PRIMARY | ✅ Verified | ✅ Verified |

**Validation Rule**: Build execution authority MUST be tied to **Per-Repository Readiness** of the build target repository, not Governance-Layer Readiness alone.

---

## 6. Progressive Activation Model

### 6.1 Activation Stages

Platform readiness is **progressive**, not binary. Different execution capabilities require different readiness thresholds:

- **Capabilities Enabled**:
  - Fully autonomous execution without human intervention
  - Self-healing on governance regression (within bounds)
  - Predictive compliance analysis
  - Proactive gap remediation
- **Governance Position**: This stage is aspirational; may not be achievable or desirable for all contexts

### 6.2 Stage Declaration Rules

**Readiness declarations MUST specify activation stage**:
- "Platform ready for Manual Execution (Stage 3)" — explicit
- "Platform ready for governed build execution" — ambiguous (defaults to Stage 3 minimum)
- Higher stages inherit all lower stage prerequisites

**Stage transitions MUST be explicit**:
- Cannot skip stages without satisfying prerequisites
- Stage regression MUST trigger halt and re-validation
- Stage advancement requires validation against next stage prerequisites

### 6.3 Integration with Readiness States

Activation stages are **orthogonal** to readiness states (GREEN/AMBER/RED):

- **Stage 2, AMBER**: Repository ready with exceptions (e.g., continuous monitoring deferred)
- **Stage 3, GREEN**: Manual execution fully ready, no exceptions
- **Stage 4, RED**: Delegated execution attempted but Maturion Runtime not operational

**Validation**: Both stage and state MUST be declared for complete readiness picture.

---

## 7. Platform Readiness State Model

### 7.1 Readiness States

**GREEN (Ready)**:
- All 6 readiness conditions are TRUE for the declared scope and activation stage
- Platform may execute governed builds at the declared activation stage
- All prerequisites satisfied with no exceptions
- Full capability authorization per activation stage

**AMBER (Degraded - Human Review Required)**:
- All REQUIRED conditions satisfied
- DEGRADABLE conditions incomplete (per Section 7.2)
- Requires explicit human authorization (Johan) to proceed
- Degradation documented with remediation plan
- Authorization recorded in readiness evidence
- May proceed only with documented exception
- Time-bound remediation required

**RED (Not Ready - Execution Blocked)**:
- Any REQUIRED condition is FALSE
- Platform may NOT execute governed builds
- Remediation required before progression
- Execution is constitutionally prohibited

### 7.2 AMBER Exception Criteria (Explicit)

**REQUIRED Conditions** (MUST be TRUE for any readiness; AMBER NOT permitted):
- **Condition 4.1** (Governance Canon Locked): Governance completeness GREEN, no open critical gaps
- **Condition 4.2** (Governance Layer-Down): PR gates operational, branch protection proven (for target scope)
- **Condition 4.3** (Agent Contracts Bound): FM, Builder, Governance Admin contracts canonical and active
- **Condition 4.4** (STOP Mechanics): STOP authority proven, escalation paths operational

**DEGRADABLE Conditions** (May be incomplete under AMBER with explicit authorization):
- **Condition 4.5 (Readiness Artifacts)**: Non-critical artifacts deferred (e.g., advanced evidence schemas)
  - **AMBER Justification**: "Evidence schemas for conditions 4.1, 4.3, 4.4 deferred; manual validation procedures documented; automated schema validation scheduled for [date]"
  - **Risk**: Manual validation inconsistency
  - **Mitigation**: Governance Administrator performs all validations; standardized checklists
  - **Remediation Timeline**: 30 days maximum

- **Condition 4.6 (No Bootstrap Exceptions)**: Continuous monitoring deferred, manual audit active
  - **AMBER Justification**: "Automated continuous monitoring deferred; quarterly manual audits scheduled; manual re-validation on governance changes"
  - **Risk**: Readiness regression between audits
  - **Mitigation**: Governance change freeze between audits OR mandatory re-validation on change
  - **Remediation Timeline**: 90 days maximum for Phase 1 continuous monitoring

**AMBER Authorization Requirements**:
- Justification MUST cite specific enumerated DEGRADABLE condition
- Risk assessment MUST identify failure modes
- Mitigation plan MUST address identified risks
- Remediation timeline MUST be explicit and enforced
- Human authority (Johan) signature REQUIRED
- AMBER state MUST be reviewed at remediation deadline (transition to GREEN or escalate)

**AMBER Prohibitions**:
- AMBER MUST NOT be used for convenience or schedule pressure
- AMBER MUST NOT permit critical enforcement gaps (gates, contracts, STOP authority untested)
- AMBER MUST NOT be renewed without re-authorization
- AMBER beyond remediation timeline requires escalation and new authorization

### 7.3 State Transitions

**RED → AMBER**:
- All REQUIRED conditions satisfied
- DEGRADABLE conditions incomplete with valid AMBER justification
- Human review authorizes acceptable risk

**AMBER → GREEN**:
- All DEGRADABLE conditions satisfied
- No exceptions required
- Full readiness achieved

**GREEN → AMBER or RED**:
- Governance regression detected
- Enforcement failure identified
- Agent contract violation observed
- Requires immediate halt and remediation

**AMBER → RED** (Remediation Failure):
- Remediation timeline exceeded without completion
- Risk materializes (mitigation insufficient)
- Human authority revokes AMBER authorization

**Invariant**: State transitions MUST be explicit and auditable. No implicit state changes.

### 5.2 State Transitions

**RED → AMBER**:
- All required conditions satisfied
- Optional conditions incomplete
- Human review determines acceptable risk

**AMBER → GREEN**:
- All optional conditions satisfied
- No exceptions required
- Full readiness achieved

**GREEN → AMBER or RED**:
- Governance regression detected
- Enforcement failure identified
- Agent contract violation observed
- Requires immediate halt and remediation

**Invariant**: State transitions MUST be explicit and auditable. No implicit state changes.

---

## 8. Authority Model

### 8.1 Declaration Authority

Platform readiness may be **declared only** by:
1. **Johan Ras (Constitutional Authority)** - Ultimate authority
2. **Governance Administrator** - Based on canonical validation
3. **Codex Control (Delegated)** - With explicit constitutional authority

**Prohibited Declarants**:
- FM (cannot declare own readiness)
- Builders (no authority over platform state)
- Automated systems (declaration requires human judgment)

### 8.2 Validation Authority

Platform readiness may be **validated** by:
- Governance Administrator (continuous audit)
- Governance Enforcement workflows (CI validation)
- Human authority (Johan) at any time

### 8.3 Revocation Authority

Platform readiness may be **revoked** by:
- Johan Ras (immediate revocation for any reason)
- Governance Administrator (on detection of constitutional violation)
- Automated circuit breaker (on cascading failure detection)

### 8.4 Non-Revocability Principle

**Readiness declarations are non-revocable by the declarant** once issued.

- Prevents subjective reinterpretation
- Ensures audit trail integrity
- Forces explicit state management

**Exception**: Human authority (Johan) may override any declaration at any time.

Incorrect declarations are corrected through:
- Governance learning promotion (not retroactive amendment)
- Root cause analysis
- Updated readiness criteria (prospective only)

---

## 9. Enforcement Model

### 13.1 Pre-Execution Gate

Platform readiness acts as a **hard gate** before any build execution:

```
FUNCTION authorize_build_execution():
    readiness_state = evaluate_platform_readiness()
    
    IF readiness_state == GREEN:
        RETURN AUTHORIZED
    
    IF readiness_state == AMBER:
        IF human_authorization_exists():
            RETURN AUTHORIZED_WITH_EXCEPTION
        ELSE:
            RETURN BLOCKED ("Human authorization required")
    
    IF readiness_state == RED:
        RETURN BLOCKED ("Platform not ready for governed build execution")
```

### 13.2 Continuous Monitoring

Platform readiness is **not a one-time check**:
- Continuous validation during execution
- Automatic halt on readiness regression
- Re-validation after governance changes
- Periodic audit (quarterly minimum)

### 13.3 Enforcement Mechanisms

**Human-Driven Execution** (Current):
- Manual validation against canonical checklist
- Human (Johan) validates readiness before FM activation
- Audit trail in readiness evidence document

**Automated Enforcement** (Future):
- Maturion runtime validates readiness deterministically
- Automated halt on readiness violation
- Real-time readiness monitoring
- Automatic incident creation on regression

**Invariant**: Automation is a consequence of this canon, not a prerequisite. This canon is immediately enforceable through manual validation.

---

## 10. Readiness Evidence Requirements

### 10.1 Evidence Artifact

Platform readiness MUST be documented in a canonical evidence artifact:

**Path**: `governance/evidence/PLATFORM_READINESS_EVIDENCE.md` (or build-specific path)

**Required Sections**:
1. **Readiness Declaration**
   - State (GREEN/AMBER/RED)
   - Declaration date
   - Declarant (name and authority)
   - Canonical version applied

2. **Condition Validation**
   - For each of 6 readiness conditions:
     - Validation result (TRUE/FALSE)
     - Evidence sources
     - Validation method
     - Validator identity

3. **Exception Documentation** (if AMBER)
   - Condition(s) not satisfied
   - Risk assessment
   - Mitigation plan
   - Authorization (Johan signature)
   - Remediation timeline

4. **Audit Trail**
   - Previous readiness states
   - State transition history
   - Revocations (if any)
   - Re-validations performed

5. **Canonical References**
   - This canon (version)
   - Related governance documents
   - Enforcement workflows used

**Schema**: Defined in `governance/schemas/PLATFORM_READINESS_EVIDENCE.schema.md`

### 10.2 Evidence Lifecycle

**Creation**: When platform readiness is first assessed
**Update**: On state transitions, re-validations, or governance changes
**Retention**: Permanent (lifetime of platform)
**Access**: Read-only to all agents, write-only to authorized declarants

---

## 11. Integration with Existing Governance

### 13.1 Relationship to Initialization Completeness Gate

**Precedence**: Initialization Completeness Gate is a **prerequisite** for Platform Readiness.

A platform cannot be ready for build execution if repositories are not properly initialized.

**Validation Sequence**:
```
1. Repository Initialization (per INITIALIZATION_COMPLETENESS_GATE.md)
2. → Platform Readiness (this canon)
3. → Build Execution Authorization
```

**Dependency**: Platform Readiness condition 4.5 depends on Initialization Gate being GREEN.

### 13.2 Relationship to Architecture Completeness Requirements

**Integration**: Platform Readiness condition 4.5 requires that architecture gating mechanisms are defined.

Platform Readiness ensures the **gating system exists**; Architecture Completeness ensures **individual architectures are complete**.

### 13.3 Relationship to Agent Role Gate Applicability

**Integration**: Platform Readiness condition 4.3 requires agent contracts to be canonically bound.

Agent Role Gate Applicability defines how gates apply to different agents; Platform Readiness ensures those definitions exist and are enforced.

### 13.4 Relationship to Governance Completeness Model

**Integration**: This canon adds new components to the Governance Completeness Model:

**Component Registry Addition**:
```
| Component ID | Required Artifacts | Notes / Purpose | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| PLATFORM_READINESS_CANON | governance/canon/PLATFORM_READINESS_FOR_GOVERNED_BUILD_EXECUTION.md | Defines platform readiness for build execution | GOVERNANCE_PURPOSE_SCOPE, INITIALIZATION_GATE, AGENT_ROLE_APPLICABILITY |
| PLATFORM_READINESS_CHECKLIST | governance/templates/PLATFORM_READINESS_CHECKLIST.template.md | Template for readiness validation | PLATFORM_READINESS_CANON |
| PLATFORM_READINESS_EVIDENCE_SCHEMA | governance/schemas/PLATFORM_READINESS_EVIDENCE.schema.md | Normative structure for readiness evidence | PLATFORM_READINESS_CANON |
```

### 11.5 Relationship to Build Philosophy

**Constitutional Alignment**: This canon implements Build Philosophy principles:
- QA-as-proof (condition 4.3, 4.5)
- One-Time Build Law (condition 4.1, 4.2)
- Evidence over intent (all conditions require validation)
- No shortcuts (condition 4.6)

---

## 10. Applicability and Lifecycle

### 10.1 Effective Date

**Immediate**: This canon is effective upon merge to `main` branch.

### 10.2 Retroactive Application

**Not Retroactive**: This canon does **not** retroactively invalidate bootstrap actions.

Bootstrap execution (Wave 0) predates this canon and is governed by historical learnings documented in `BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md`.

### 10.3 Future Application

**Mandatory**: All future build executions MUST satisfy this canon.

No exceptions permitted except as defined in Section 6 (Authority Model) with explicit human authorization.

### 10.4 Transition Period

**None**: No transition period required.

This canon codifies existing implicit expectations, not new requirements.

---

## 13. Special Cases and Edge Conditions

### 13.1 Emergency Execution (Security)

**Scenario**: Critical security vulnerability requires immediate build execution before full readiness.

**Response**:
1. Human authority (Johan) may authorize emergency execution
2. Readiness state set to AMBER with documented exception
3. Security risk documented as justification
4. Remediation plan required with timeline
5. Post-execution audit mandatory
6. Learning promoted to prevent recurrence

**Outcome**: Emergency execution does NOT weaken this canon. Exception is explicit and auditable.

### 13.2 Governance Regression During Execution

**Scenario**: Platform readiness regresses to RED during active build execution.

**Response**:
1. Automatic halt of all build activities (if automated)
2. Manual halt instruction to FM and builders (if human-driven)
3. Governance Administrator escalates to Johan
4. Root cause analysis required
5. Remediation before execution resumes
6. Re-validation of readiness before resumption

**Outcome**: Execution does NOT continue with degraded readiness. Halt is mandatory.

### 13.3 Partial Readiness (New Platform)

**Scenario**: New platform (e.g., Maturion Cloud) needs readiness assessment before full deployment.

**Response**:
1. Evaluate readiness against all 6 conditions
2. Document gaps explicitly
3. State = RED or AMBER depending on criticality
4. Phased deployment plan with readiness milestones
5. Re-assessment at each milestone
6. GREEN required before production workloads

**Outcome**: No platform executes builds without readiness validation.

### 13.4 Legacy Platform (Pre-Canon)

**Scenario**: Existing platform (e.g., GitHub + Copilot) predates this canon.

**Response**:
1. Retroactive readiness assessment
2. Document current state against 6 conditions
3. Identify gaps and create remediation plan
4. Set realistic timeline for GREEN state
5. AMBER authorization if gaps are non-critical
6. Continuous improvement until GREEN

**Outcome**: Legacy platforms brought into compliance progressively.

## 12. Compliance and Audit

### 12.1 Audit Requirements

**Frequency**: Quarterly minimum, or after:
- Major governance changes
- Agent contract updates
- Platform changes
- Execution incidents
- Human authority request

**Audit Scope**:
- All 6 readiness conditions re-validated
- Evidence artifact updated
- State transitions documented
- Gaps identified and remediation planned

**Auditor**: Governance Administrator (primary), Johan (oversight)

### 12.2 Audit Trail

**Required Records**:
- Readiness declarations (all historical)
- State transitions (with justification)
- Validation results (evidence sources)
- Exceptions granted (with authorization)
- Revocations (with cause)
- Remediations (with completion status)

**Retention**: Permanent (lifetime of platform)

### 12.3 Compliance Reporting

Platform readiness status MUST be reported:
- To Johan (on request)
- To FM (before activation)
- To Governance Administrator (continuous awareness)
- In governance audit reports

**Report Format**: Defined in readiness evidence schema

---

## 13. Success Criteria

This canon succeeds when:

✅ **No build execution begins without validated readiness**  
✅ **Readiness criteria are objective and verifiable**  
✅ **Readiness state is always known and auditable**  
✅ **Premature execution is constitutionally impossible**  
✅ **Readiness regressions are detected and halted**  
✅ **All agents respect readiness as a hard gate**  
✅ **Human authority can validate readiness at any time**

---

## 14. Relationship to Other Governance Documents

- **CONSTITUTION.md** - Governance supremacy, human authority
- **GOVERNANCE_PURPOSE_AND_SCOPE.md** - Build philosophy, role definitions
- **GOVERNANCE_COMPLETENESS_MODEL.md** - Governance structure requirements
- **INITIALIZATION_COMPLETENESS_GATE.md** - Repository initialization prerequisite

### 14.2 Downstream Dependencies (Other Documents Depend On This)

- **FM Activation Protocol** (future) - Requires readiness validation before FM activation
- **Builder Recruitment Protocol** (future) - Requires readiness validation before builder assignment
- **Maturion Runtime Authorization** (future) - Requires readiness validation before autonomous execution

### 14.3 Parallel Canons

## 18. Changelog

### Version 2.0.0 (2025-12-31)

**Status**: Major Update — Gap Closure  
**Authority**: Johan Ras  
**Trigger**: Phase 2.1 — Governance Canon Update (BL-009 Closure)  
**Grounded In**: `PLATFORM_READINESS_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` (Phase 1.2)

**Summary**: Updated Platform Readiness Canon to explicitly close critical readiness definition gaps identified in Phase 1.2, eliminating recurrence risk of BL-009–style premature readiness declarations.

**Critical Gaps Closed**:
- **GAP-001**: Added deterministic validation methods for all 6 readiness conditions (Section 4, all subsections)
- **GAP-002**: Explicitly distinguished "defined" vs "operational" vs "enforced" with operational definitions and enforcement proof requirements (Sections 4.2, 4.6)
- **GAP-003**: Added repository scope model distinguishing governance-layer, per-repository, and ecosystem-wide readiness (Section 5)
- **GAP-004**: Defined explicit AMBER exception criteria with REQUIRED vs DEGRADABLE condition classification (Section 7.2)
- **GAP-005**: Introduced progressive activation model with 6 activation stages (Section 6)

**New Sections Added**:
- Section 5: Repository Scope Model (governance-layer, per-repository, ecosystem-wide)
- Section 6: Progressive Activation Model (6 stages from governance-layer ready to autonomous execution ready)
- Section 7: Platform Readiness State Model (updated with explicit AMBER criteria)

**Sections Restructured**:
- Section 4 (Canonical Definition): Added "Operational Definition" and "Validation Method" subsections to all 6 conditions
- Section 7 (formerly Section 5): Expanded state model with REQUIRED vs DEGRADABLE condition classification
- Renumbered sections 5-16 to 8-18 to accommodate new sections

**Bootstrap Learnings Ratified**:
- BL-010: Platform Readiness Requires Deterministic Validation
- BL-011: Platform Readiness Must Distinguish Repository Scope
- BL-012: AMBER Readiness Requires Explicit Exception Criteria
- BL-013: Platform Readiness Must Model Progressive Activation
- BL-014: "Operational" Requires Evidence of Enforcement, Not Just Existence

**Effect**: Platform readiness is now **deterministically validatable**, **scope-explicit**, **progressively modeled**, and **enforcement-proven**. Premature readiness declarations based on ambiguity or subjective interpretation are constitutionally prohibited.

**Breaking Changes**:
- AMBER state now restricted to enumerated DEGRADABLE conditions only (conditions 4.5, 4.6 under specific circumstances)
- Readiness declarations MUST specify repository scope (governance-layer, per-repository, or ecosystem-wide)
- Readiness declarations MUST specify activation stage (Stage 1-6)
- "Operational" now requires enforcement proof, not just existence proof

**Non-Retroactive**: This update applies to future readiness declarations only. Bootstrap (Wave 0) readiness declarations remain governed by BL-009 historical context.

---

### Version 1.0.0 (2025-12-30)

**Status**: Initial Release  
**Authority**: Johan Ras  
**Trigger**: Issue G-PLAT-READY-01

**Summary**: Created canonical definition of Platform Readiness for Governed Build Execution.

**Key Requirements Established**:
- 6 mandatory readiness conditions (governance lock, layer-down, agent contracts, STOP mechanics, artifacts, no bootstrap exceptions)
- 3-state model (GREEN/AMBER/RED)
- Authority model (declaration, validation, revocation)
- Enforcement model (pre-execution gate, continuous monitoring)
- Evidence requirements (canonical artifact, lifecycle)
- Integration with existing governance (initialization, architecture, agent roles)
- Audit and compliance requirements

**Effect**: Platform readiness is now a constitutional requirement. No build execution may begin unless readiness is validated and GREEN (or AMBER with explicit human authorization).
