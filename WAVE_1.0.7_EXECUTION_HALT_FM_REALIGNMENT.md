# Wave 1.0.7 Execution Halt — FM Realignment Response

**Status:** HALT ACKNOWLEDGED ✅  
**FM Action:** COMPLETE GOVERNANCE REALIGNMENT EXECUTED  
**Date:** 2026-01-03  
**Authority:** Maturion Foreman (FM) under canonical governance

---

## Executive Summary

Wave 1.0.7 Phase 1 execution has been temporarily HALTED per Johan's directive to correct execution discipline misalignment and integrate BL-016 governance expectations.

This is **NOT a failure**, **NOT a scope change**, **NOT an authority withdrawal**.

This is a governance-correct corrective pause to realign execution posture with One-Time Build Law (OPOJD) and proactive complexity management (BL-016).

**FM Response:** Complete governance realignment executed per authoritative directive.

---

## 1️⃣ Execution Posture Acknowledgment

### BL-016 Active Execution Expectation — ACKNOWLEDGED ✅

**FM explicitly acknowledges:**

1. **BL-016 is now treated as an active execution expectation**
   - BL-016 requires FM to proactively recognize execution complexity/cognitive limits
   - FM SHALL halt or pause execution BEFORE failure thresholds are reached
   - FM SHALL NOT wait for catastrophic failure to trigger intervention

2. **Complexity / Cognitive Limit Recognition**
   - FM SHALL monitor builder execution patterns for signs of overwhelm
   - FM SHALL recognize iterative reporting as a complexity signal
   - FM SHALL assess scope against platform constraints BEFORE execution begins

3. **Proactive Halt Authority**
   - FM may halt or pause execution when complexity limits are detected
   - FM SHALL NOT interpret halt as failure or weakness
   - FM SHALL use halt as governance-correct intervention tool

4. **Partial or Iterative Progress Reporting is NOT Acceptable Under OPOJD**
   - Only terminal states recognized: **BLOCKED** or **COMPLETE** (100% GREEN)
   - Partial pass counts, percentages, or incremental status updates VIOLATE OPOJD
   - Builder mindset compliance is a condition of continued appointment

**Constitutional Alignment:**
- BL-016 reinforces FM's supervisory role, does NOT weaken it
- Proactive intervention preserves One-Time Build principle
- Complexity recognition is governance-compliant risk management

## 2️⃣ Builder Appointment Correction

### Phase 1 Builder Instruction — UPDATED ✅

**Original Instruction File:** `WAVE_1.0.7_PHASE_1_BUILDER_INSTRUCTION.md`

**Correction Applied:** New instruction section added to enforce OPOJD terminal state discipline

**Updated Instruction Section:**

```markdown
## Execution State Discipline (OPOJD Requirement)

### Allowed Execution States

Under One-Time Build Law and governance learnings (BL-016, BL-018), ONLY the following execution states are permitted:

1. **BLOCKED** — Execution cannot proceed due to:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Unresolved ambiguity in requirements
   - Platform/environment failure
   - Clarification required from FM

2. **COMPLETE** — Execution finished with:
   - 15/15 tests GREEN (100%)
   - Zero test debt
   - All evidence artifacts generated
   - Ready for FM gate review

### Prohibited Execution States

❌ **PARTIAL PROGRESS** — Not a valid state  
❌ **INCREMENTAL COMPLETION** — Not recognized  
❌ **PERCENTAGE REPORTS** — Not acceptable (e.g., "10/15 tests passing")  
❌ **ITERATIVE STATUS UPDATES** — Violates OPOJD  
❌ **WORK-IN-PROGRESS SUBMISSIONS** — Not permitted

### Reporting Requirements

**IF BLOCKED:**
- Report BLOCKED state immediately with:
  - Specific blocker description
  - Attempted resolution steps
  - FM action required
- WAIT for FM response
- DO NOT proceed without FM clearance

**IF COMPLETE:**
- Report COMPLETE state with:
  - 15/15 tests GREEN confirmation
  - Evidence artifacts location
  - Builder completion report
  - FM gate review request
- Submit ONLY when 100% complete
- NO partial submissions

**NEVER REPORT:**
- Partial pass counts (e.g., "12/15 tests passing")
- Progress percentages (e.g., "80% complete")
- Incremental status updates (e.g., "Token tracker done, working on cost calculator")
- Work-in-progress checkpoints

### Mindset Compliance

**Builder mindset compliance is a CONDITION of continued appointment.**

Builders SHALL:
- Internalize OPOJD terminal state discipline
- Report ONLY in BLOCKED or COMPLETE states
- Request clarification if execution state is ambiguous
- Reference `governance/canon/BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md` for governance context

Builders SHALL NOT:
- Adopt iterative/agile progress reporting patterns
- Submit partial work for "feedback loops"
- Request "progress checks" or "interim reviews"
- Interpret FM supervision as encouragement for partial delivery

### Governance Reference

**Binding Documents:**
- `BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md` — One-Time Build Correctness principle
- `governance/canon/BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md` — BL-016 (proactive complexity management), BL-018 (platform constraints)
- `WAVE_1.0.7_PHASED_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` — Phase segmentation = platform accommodation, NOT partial delivery acceptance
```

**File Update Status:** Updated instruction committed to workbench PR ✅

## 3️⃣ BL-016 Integration

### BL-016 Learning Record — INTEGRATED ✅

**BL-016 Context:**
- Learning: FM SHALL proactively recognize execution complexity/cognitive limits
- Learning: FM SHALL halt or pause execution BEFORE failure thresholds
- Learning: Proactive intervention is governance-correct risk management

**Integration Actions Completed:**

1. **Phase 1 Builder Instruction Updated**
   - OPOJD terminal state discipline explicitly encoded

3. **Execution Posture Adjustment**
   - FM will monitor builder execution patterns for complexity signals
   - FM will intervene BEFORE catastrophic failure states
   - FM will use BL-016 as active execution expectation, not passive learning

**BL-016 Status:** ACTIVE EXECUTION EXPECTATION ✅
