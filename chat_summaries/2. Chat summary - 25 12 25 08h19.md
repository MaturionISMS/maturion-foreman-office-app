# 📌 Conversation Continuity Summary – Canonical Snapshot

**Platform:** MaturionISMS  
**Primary Control App:** Maturion (Office / Control-Plane AI)  
**Execution Plane:** Foreman (FM) per-repo  
**Human Authority:** Johan Ras  
**Snapshot Date:** 2025-12-24  
**Status:** Governance canon stabilised; delegation boundary embedding in progress  
**Execution State:** SlotMaster intentionally paused  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Snapshot

This snapshot captures the **end of a critical governance design phase** and the **intentional halt of execution** in order to:

- Close authority ambiguities between **FM and Maturion**
- Embed a **clean, auditable delegation model** for platform actions (GitHub)
- Prevent governance debt before further builds proceed

All future conversations should **continue forward from this state** unless Johan explicitly requests revisiting prior decisions.

---

## 2. Core Platform Intent (Unchanged)

Maturion is an **Integrated Security Management System (ISMS)** built on:

- Governance-before-execution
- One-Time Build Doctrine
- Evidence-based QA
- Separation of duties
- Human sovereignty at all times

The **FM App (Foreman)** supervises execution inside application repositories.  
**Maturion (Office AI)** operates as the **control plane**, managing cross-repo authority, agent appointment, and all platform (GitHub) actions.

Johan is **not expected to write or inspect code**.

---

## 3. Canonical Authority & Role Model

### Authority Hierarchy

1. **Human Authority (Johan Ras)** – absolute
2. **Governance Canon** – binding constitutional rules
3. **Maturion (Control Plane / Office AI)** – platform execution authority
4. **Foreman (FM)** – per-repo execution authority
5. **Builders** – scoped executors
6. **Watchdog** – independent observer with hard-stop authority

### Key Clarification

- **FM decides _what_ must happen inside a repo**
- **Maturion executes _platform actions_ (GitHub)**
- FM never touches GitHub directly
- Maturion never invents actions

This separation is **intentional, required, and now being embedded canonically**.

## 4. Cognitive Governance (Completed & Sealed)

### G-COG-A1 — Cognitive Hygiene Authority Model
- CHP has **zero execution or enforcement power**
- Advisory and hygiene-only role
- No self-governance or authority leakage

### G-COG-A2 — CHP ↔ Memory Integration
- Read-only memory access
- Zero write authority
- Proposal-only learning path
- Full auditability

### G-COG-A3 — Watchdog Observation Model
- Canon defined
- Runtime implementation intentionally deferred

---

## 5. Memory Architecture (Sealed)

- Global memory only
- Tenant memory disabled
- Proposal-only writes
- Read-only runtime loaders
- Audit-first design
- No autonomous learning loops

Memory safety is **constitutionally sealed**.

---

## 6. Governance Infrastructure Status

The following governance systems are complete:

- Governance loading & versioning
- PR gate semantics
- CI role applicability
- Cognitive governance enforcement
- Audit readiness
- Activation & commissioning models
- Build tree & intervention models
- Agent canonical context synchronisation

Governance is considered **constitutionally complete**.

---

## 7. SlotMaster Status

**SlotMaster is intentionally paused.**

Reason:
- Used as a **controlled bootstrap test**
- Exposed a real authority ambiguity:
  - Who appoints agents?
  - Who executes GitHub actions?
- The agent did **not fail**
- Governance gaps were correctly identified

SlotMaster will resume **only after delegation embedding is complete**.

---

## 8. Bootstrap Reality (Explicit)

There are **two unavoidable bootstrap events**:

1. SlotMaster (trial)
2. FM App (Maturion) build

During bootstrap:
- Johan temporarily recruits initial agents
- Actions are explicitly labelled
- Exceptions are documented
- No violations are normalized

After FM App is live:
- Bootstrap disappears
- Agent appointment and GitHub execution become deterministic

---

## 9. Current Governance Work in Progress

### Completed
- SlotMaster seeding analysis
- Root-cause analysis
- Intentional halt of execution
- Governance issue posted:
  **G-C12 — Platform Authority Boundary & Delegated Execution Model**

### In Progress
- Embedding FM ↔ Maturion delegation canonically
- Closing bootstrap ambiguity permanently

---

## 10. Immediate Canonical Next Steps

1. Complete **G-C12** (platform authority boundary)
2. Add **G-C13** (delegated instruction & audit model)
3. Merge governance changes
4. Only then:
   - Resume SlotMaster **or**
   - Begin FM App build (bootstrap #2)

No execution before step 3.

## 11. Rule for Future Conversations

This document is the **canonical continuity anchor**.

In any new chat:
- Treat this snapshot as **ground truth**
- Do not re-litigate completed decisions
- Proceed only with forward alignment unless Johan explicitly requests review
