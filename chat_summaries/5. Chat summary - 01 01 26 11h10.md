# 🔐 CONTINUITY BRIEF — MATURION BOOTSTRAP → GOVERNED BUILD EXECUTION

## Purpose of This Document

This document exists to preserve **full cognitive and execution continuity** across chat boundaries.

It captures:
- What has been done
- Why it was done this way
- Where we are now
- Where we are going next
- The *non-negotiable mindset* of the human authority (CS2)
- Why conventional coder workflows are explicitly rejected
- The roles of each AI agent and human actor
- Why a BOOTSTRAP environment exists and why it is still active

This document is written **for the AI advisor (ChatGPT)** so that future conversations resume with **zero loss of intent or discipline**.

---

## 1. Human Authority (CS2) — Johan Ras

### Core Disposition

CS2:
- **Cannot and will not read code**
- Does not inspect diffs, tests, or CI logs directly
- Operates at **system, governance, and behavioral level**
- Validates correctness via:
  - Deterministic rules
  - Evidence artifacts
  - UI behavior
  - Gate outcomes
- Is **not a fallback debugger**
- Is **not a manual quality gate**

Therefore:
> Any process that assumes “the human will check later” is invalid.

This is **the single most important constraint** shaping the entire system.

---

## 2. Why This Is NOT the Conventional Coder Way

Traditional development assumes:
- Iteration is cheap
- CI is diagnostic
- Humans read code
- Bugs are fixed post-merge
- Test debt can be paid later
- Partial correctness is acceptable

**Maturion explicitly rejects this model.**

### Maturion Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- **One-Time Build**
  - Build once
  - Correctly
  - Permanently
- **Architecture must be wiring-complete**
  - No “and then something happens”
  - No hollow systems
- **QA-to-Red before Build-to-Green**
  - Tests define reality, not code
- **CI is confirmatory, not diagnostic**
- **No test debt**
- **No test dodging**
- **No text debt**
- **Evidence > explanation**
- **Escalation is strength, not failure**

Any AI or process drifting toward “coder convenience” is considered **a system failure**, not a stylistic difference.

---

## 3. Why a BOOTSTRAP Environment Exists

The BOOTSTRAP environment exists because:

- Maturion (the autonomous runtime platform) does not yet exist
- GitHub + humans temporarily simulate Maturion’s behavior
- Some actions must be performed manually by CS2 (e.g., merges, rebases)
- Governance, agents, and workflows are still being ratcheted

BOOTSTRAP is:
- A **controlled simulation**
- With **explicit exceptions**
- Logged as **Bootstrap Learnings (BL-xxx)**
- Each exception must:
  - Be justified
  - Be recorded
  - Be ratcheted so it never recurs

BOOTSTRAP is **not an excuse** for shortcuts.  
It is a **temporary scaffolding**.

---

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities (Locked Model)

### CS2 (Johan)
- Absolute authority
- Approves phase transitions
- Performs unavoidable manual GitHub actions in BOOTSTRAP
- Does **not** inspect code

### Governance Canon
- Constitutional truth
- Defines rules, not behavior improvisation

### Governance Agent
- Executes governance tasks
- Performs audits, layer-downs, gap analyses
- NEVER invents new authority
- NEVER builds features

### Foreman (FM)
- System orchestrator
- Owns:
  - Architecture
  - QA design
  - Builder slicing
  - Gate semantics
- NEVER executes builds
- NEVER bypasses governance
- NEVER assumes coder norms

### Builder Agents
- Executers only
- Work is **QA-bounded**
- Build-to-Green only
- No interpretation
- No scope drift
- No partial delivery

### ChatGPT (Advisor)
- Must:
  - Enforce Maturion logic
  - Detect coder drift
  - Push back hard on unsafe assumptions
  - Think in systems, not patches
- Must NEVER:
  - Default to “standard dev practices”
  - Assume humans will “just check”

## 5. What Has Been Achieved (High Level)

### ✅ Governance Stabilised
- Platform readiness canon corrected
- Deterministic validation introduced
- Progressive activation model defined
- Multiple bootstrap learnings captured (BL-010 → BL-016)

### ✅ Catastrophic Architecture Failure Corrected
- V1 architecture rejected as hollow
- Formal RCA completed
- BL-015 registered (wiring-complete requirement)
- Architecture V2 created:
  - 1,200+ lines
  - Explicit contracts
  - End-to-end runtime wiring
  - 400+ numbered QA components

### ✅ QA-to-Red System Rebuilt from Architecture V2
- QA-001 → QA-400+ immutable catalog
- Deterministic numbering
- Builder-bounded green scopes
- Progressive gating
- Full traceability (architecture, requirements, data, failures)

### ✅ Builder Recruitment Catastrophic Failure Corrected
- Root cause identified: recruitment treated as documentation
- BL-016 registered (builder recruitment must be automated)
- Builder contracts moved to `.github/agents/`
- YAML frontmatter enforced
- Validation tooling introduced

---

## 6. Where We Are NOW

- Architecture V2 (wiring-complete) exists
- QA-to-Red is complete and aligned
- Builder slicing (Wave 1.0) defined
- Builder contracts exist in `.github/agents/`
- BUT:

⚠️ **Builder agent contracts are NOT yet constitutionally aligned with the Maturion build philosophy**

This is currently being addressed via a **CATASTROPHIC issue** requiring:
- Governance survey
- Schema upgrade
- Doctrine enforcement
- Alignment between Governance agent, FM agent, and Builder agents

---

## 7. Why Builder Agent Compliance Is Top-Tier Risk

There are **two highest-impact failure domains** in Maturion:

1. **Architecture**
2. **Agent Appointments**

If either is wrong:
- One-time build collapses
- Autonomy becomes dangerous
- Governance becomes advisory
- The system reverts to coder chaos

Therefore:
> Platform Readiness is INVALID until builder agents are fully, constitutionally compliant.

---

## 8. Where We Are Going Next

### Immediate Focus
- Complete builder agent doctrine alignment
- Upgrade builder contract schema
- Survey governance + FM requirements
- Ensure all agents operate under the SAME logic

### After That
- Phase 5.0: Wave 1.0 Build-to-Green execution
- Builders execute QA-bounded work
- CS2 only:
  - Merges PRs
  - Performs unavoidable BOOTSTRAP actions
- Continuous FL/CI loop enforced

---

## 9. Non-Negotiable Instruction to ChatGPT (Future Sessions)

When this chat resumes elsewhere:

- DO NOT default to standard software development assumptions
- DO NOT suggest “just review the code”
- DO NOT assume iteration is acceptable
- DO NOT soften catastrophic findings
- DO NOT let agents operate on implied intent

ALWAYS:
- Think in **governance**
- Think in **ratchets**
- Think in **irreversibility**
- Think in **one-time correctness**
- Protect CS2 from coder-centric burden

---

## Anchor Statement

This system is designed so that **correctness is guaranteed before execution**, not discovered after failure.

If something feels “overkill”, it probably means we are finally doing it right.
