# 📌 Canonical Chat Summary — FM One-Time Build Execution Reset & Re-Alignment

**Workspace:** MaturionISMS  
**Primary Repository:** `maturion-foreman-office-app`  
**Governance Repository:** `maturion-foreman-governance`  
**Human Authority (CS2):** Johan Ras  
**Execution Authority:** Maturion Foreman (FM)  
**Governance Executor:** Governance Agent  
**Build Model:** One-Time Build (Architecture → QA-to-Red → Build-to-Green)  
**Snapshot State:** Step 1 In Progress (PR-Gate Release Checks System)  
**Date:** 2025-12-30

## 1. Purpose of This Summary

This summary captures the **authoritative state of the program** after:

- Completion of Wave 0 bootstrap
- Discovery of execution drift toward coder-centric behavior
- Governance correction and hard stop
- Formal resolution of the Branch Protection governance gap
- Re-anchoring execution to a **single, agreed master checklist**
- Launch of Step 1 of Wave 1 under controlled conditions

This document exists to:

- Preserve continuity across chats and PRs
- Prevent checklist drift
- Provide a single “where we are / what’s next” reference
- Act as an execution guardrail for FM and Governance Agents

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Intent (True North)

This platform is **not coder-centric**.

It is a **governed orchestration system** designed for a human authority (CS2) who:

- Does **not** read code
- Validates only via **UI, behavior, and evidence**
- Requires **irreversibility and correctness first time**

Therefore:

- Governance precedes execution  
- Architecture precedes QA  
- QA precedes build  
- CI is **confirmatory, not diagnostic**  
- Builders build **only to green**  
- Human manual platform actions are exceptions, not dependencies  

Any drift back to:
> “We’ll fix it in CI / PR / iteration”

is constitutionally invalid.

---

## 3. Authority Model (Locked)

1. **CS2 (Johan Ras)** — absolute human authority  
2. **Governance Canon** — constitutional rules  
3. **Maturion (future runtime)** — platform execution  
4. **Foreman (FM)** — planning, architecture, sequencing  
5. **Builders** — scoped executors (build-to-green only)  
6. **Governance Agent** — governance implementation & layer-down  

Key constraints:

- FM never executes platform actions  
- Governance agents never build features  
- Builders never design or interpret intent  
- CS2 never performs routine GitHub administration

## 4. What Was Completed Successfully

### 4.1 Wave 0 Bootstrap (Complete)

**Wave 0.1**
- Builder recruitment and validation completed
- Evidence captured and approved

**Wave 0.2**
- Task orchestration and execution proxy validated
- No production build executed

### 4.2 Governance Stabilisation

- Core governance canon locked
- Agent constitutions and role boundaries clarified
- Governance layer-down gaps identified
- `BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md` created
- Multiple BLs captured (including governance sequencing failures)

---

## 5. Critical Failure Identified (Key Inflection Point)

During early Wave 1 activity, a serious defect was detected:

- FM execution drifted toward coder-centric assumptions
- Architecture was not clearly surfaced as a single canonical artifact
- QA-to-Red was not established as a hard gate
- PR-gate readiness was assumed instead of proven
- Branch protection enforcement was ambiguous
- Governance layer-down was incomplete at FM repo level

This would have collapsed the system into a traditional “AI writes code” loop.

**Correct action taken:**  
Execution was **intentionally stopped** before irreversible work.

---

## 6. Governance Correction & Resolution

### 6.1 Governance Layer-Down Audit
- Comprehensive audit performed
- Confirmed governance was *substantially* layered down
- Identified one **critical blocking gap**: Branch Protection enforcement

### 6.2 Branch Protection Governance Resolution
Governance PR #818 formally resolved the gap:

- Branch protection declared **constitutional**
- Enforcement defined as **programmatically verifiable**
- Responsibility clarified:
  - Governance defines
  - FM ensures & evidences
  - CS2 authorizes
- Manual CS2 action allowed **only as explicit bootstrap exception**
- Platform Readiness updated accordingly

This removed the last structural blocker.

## 7. Execution Reset & Re-Alignment

Key decisions:

- No further execution without checklist alignment
- No “helpful” improvisation by FM
- No silent governance assumptions
- Single master checklist locked as the execution authority

FM was explicitly instructed (via issue) that:
- His plan remains authoritative
- Two prerequisites must be inserted:
  1. PR-Gate Release Checks System
  2. Branch Protection governance consumption

## 9. Current State (Now)

- Governance corrected and merged
- Branch protection rule constitutional
- FM plan alignment issue submitted
- **Step 1 issued and queued:**  
  **#239 — PR-Gate Release Checks System**
- No QA or build execution has begun
- Checklist is the single execution authority

---

## 10. Immediate Next Actions

1. FM completes Step 1 (#239)
2. Evidence reviewed against checklist §5
3. CS2 verifies and accepts Step 1
4. Only then: Step 2 (QA-to-Red)

---

## 11. Anchor Statement

We are not delayed.  
We are preventing irreversible failure.

Execution resumes **only when the checklist allows it**.

This is what a One-Time Build system looks like.
