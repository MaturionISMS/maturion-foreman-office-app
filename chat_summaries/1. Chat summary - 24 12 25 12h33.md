# Conversation Continuity Summary – Canonical Snapshot

**Platform:** MaturionISMS  
**Primary Control App:** Maturion Foreman (FM App)  
**Owner / Human Authority:** Johan Ras  
**Snapshot Date:** 2025-12-24  
**Status:** Governance complete; platform entering controlled build phase

---

## 1. Platform Vision & Intent

The Maturion platform is an **Integrated Security Management System (ISMS)** built under strict governance principles:

- **One-Time Build Doctrine** (no regression, no legacy carryover)
- **Governance-before-Execution**
- **Evidence-based QA**
- **Separation of Duties**
- **Human Sovereignty preserved at all times**

The **Foreman App** is the **overarching management and control center** for all applications in the MaturionISMS GitHub organization. It supervises builders, orchestrates work, enforces governance, manages memory safely, and escalates only when required.

The user is **not a coder** and must not be required to review code, logs, or PR internals.  
The system must operate **autonomously within governance**, escalating only when:
- Governance contradictions occur
- Canon is missing
- Security risks exist
- One-Time Build is threatened

## 2. Authority & Role Model (Final)

### Authority Hierarchy (Canonical)

1. **Human Authority (Johan Ras)** – Supreme, absolute override
2. **Governance Canon** – Binding constitutional rules
3. **Foreman (FM App AI)** – Supervisory authority (POLC model)
4. **Cognitive Hygiene Process (CHP)** – Peer-level advisory system to Foreman
5. **Builders** – Subordinate executors
6. **Watchdog** – Independent, read-only observer with hard-stop authority

> **Critical distinction:**  
> *Operational flow* ≠ *authority hierarchy*  
> CHP → Foreman → Builders is an **information/advisory flow**, not power delegation.

---

## 3. Cognitive Governance (Completed Waves)

### G-COG-A1 — Cognitive Hygiene Authority Model ✅
- CHP has **no decision, enforcement, authorization, or execution powers**
- CHP may **observe, analyze, advise, and maintain hygiene**
- No self-governance, no authority leakage
- Escalations are **signals only**, never actions

### G-COG-A2 — Cognitive Hygiene ↔ Memory Integration Model ✅
- CHP has **read-only memory access**
- **Zero write authority**
- **No auto-learning**
- Memory updates only via **proposal → governance approval**
- Full auditability enforced

### G-COG-A3 — Watchdog Observation Protocol (in progress / queued)
- Watchdog observes CHP, Foreman, governance alignment, memory integrity, and vision drift
- Watchdog does not execute changes
- Hard stops only for catastrophic conditions (security, canon corruption)

---

## 4. Memory Architecture (Current State)

### Memory Principles
- **One AI identity, multiple embodiments**
- **Global memory enabled**
- **Tenant memory explicitly disabled (for now)**
- **Proposal-only memory writes**
- **Read-only runtime loaders**
- **Audit-first design**

### Implemented
- Canonical memory scaffolding
- Memory authority policies (read, write, forget)
- Global memory runtime (read-only)
- Memory proposal system
- Governance memory sync & invalidation
- Legacy memory archived safely

### Not Yet Activated
- Auto-learning
- Tenant memory
- Runtime learning loops

Activation will occur via **post-build commissioning UI**, not automatically.

---

## 5. Governance Infrastructure Completed

- Governance loading protocol
- PR gate evaluation & role applicability
- Governance enforcement transition
- Governance versioning & sync protocol
- Vision alignment & drift model (non-blocking)
- Maturion conceptual doctrine (non-binding)
- Independent Watchdog authority & scope
- Cognitive capability orchestration model

Governance is considered **constitutionally complete**.

---

## 6. Foreman App (FM) Expectations

Foreman is a **real supervisor**, not a task runner.

Entrenched principles:
- **Planning** – Decompose work, plan waves
- **Organising** – Appoint correct builders
- **Leading** – Guide execution, resolve conflicts
- **Controlling** – Enforce governance, verify outcomes

Foreman must:
- Run pre-flight governance checks
- Predict PR gate outcomes before submission
- Escalate only when required
- Never submit a PR it knows will fail governance
- Use governance canon as the single source of truth

---

## 7. Build & Commissioning Philosophy

The platform will include a **post-build commissioning UI** that allows the human to:

- Verify readiness step-by-step
- Activate subsystems gradually (memory, learning, governance hooks)
- See clear GREEN / RED indicators
- Receive alerts requiring intervention
- Maintain full audit trails

Think: **“wake the system up safely”**, not “flip a switch”.

## 8. Current State

- Governance: **COMPLETE**
- Cognitive authority: **SEALED**
- Memory safety: **SEALED**
- Watchdog: **Defined, not yet implemented**
- FM app: **Ready to build**
- ISMS app: **Pending FM readiness**

---

## 9. Immediate Next Steps (Post-Snapshot)

1. Complete G-COG-A3 (Watchdog Observation Protocol)
2. Run architecture alignment surveys (read-only)
3. Run FM governance readiness survey
4. Finalize Foreman & Builder agent contract alignment
5. Begin controlled FM app build
6. Commission FM via UI-driven activation
7. Proceed to ISMS build

## 10. Operating Rule for Future Chats

This document is the **authoritative continuity snapshot**.  
Any new conversation must treat this as **canonical context** and continue forward without revisiting completed decisions unless explicitly requested by Human Authority.
