# 🌊 RIPPLE INTELLIGENCE LAYER (RIL) — IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (STATUS TRACKED)

## Status Legend
- ✅ GREEN — Completed & merged
- 🟡 AMBER — In progress / posted / awaiting feedback
- 🔴 RED — Not started

---

## PURPOSE

Establish a **proactive Ripple Intelligence Layer (RIL)** that provides pre-execution
awareness of non-local impact, while remaining strictly subordinate to runtime
enforcement and merge gates.

Ripple Intelligence provides **visibility**, not authority.  
Runtime enforcement remains the **only blocking mechanism**.

---

## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

- Governance is the source of truth
- Ripple Intelligence is **pre-execution awareness**
- Runtime enforcement is **execution-time authority**
- FM is the **operational convergence point**
- Automation must never replace responsibility
- One-Time Build Law remains intact

---

## RIPPLE-WAVE 1 — CONCEPTUAL & GOVERNANCE FOUNDATION

### Objective
Define Ripple Intelligence as a first-class governance concept and align agent mindset
and authority accordingly.

---

### 🔹 RIPPLE-WAVE 1.1 — Ripple Intelligence Concept Definition  
**Status:** ✅ GREEN

**Delivered**
- Canonical definition of Ripple Intelligence Layer
- Three ripple planes defined:
  1. Proactive Downward Ripple (pre-merge, pre-execution)
  2. Reactive Runtime Ripple (execution-time enforcement)
  3. Upward Learning Ripple (governance evolution)
- Terminology reconciliation: ripple vs runtime
- Conceptual ripple trigger classification

---

### 🔹 RIPPLE-WAVE 1.2 — Agent Mindset & Authority Alignment  
**Status:** ✅ GREEN

**Delivered**
- Agent Ripple Awareness Obligation canon
- Role applicability clarified
- Recruitment & contract authority explicitly defined
- FM responsibility for downstream coherence formalized
- Draft agent ripple language prepared (PARKED)
- No agent files modified

---

## RIPPLE-WAVE 2 — ASSISTED RIPPLE AWARENESS (REPORTING ONLY)

### Objective
Introduce assisted ripple awareness without enforcement, automation, or runtime impact.

---

### 🔹 RIPPLE-WAVE 2.1 — Assisted Local Repository Ripple Scan  
**Status:** ✅ GREEN

**Delivered**
- Assisted ripple scan scope canon
- Ripple scan report schema
- Ripple scan report template
- Human review semantics canon
- Enhancement learnings captured
- Strictly informational, non-blocking

---

### 🔹 RIPPLE-WAVE 2.2 — Passive Cross-Repository Ripple Awareness  
**Status:** 🟡 AMBER

**State**
- Posted and under review
- Defines passive, non-executable awareness across repositories
- No responsibility shift
- No enforcement
- No automation

(Awaiting agent feedback / review outcome)

---

### 🔹 RIPPLE-WAVE 2.3 — Ripple ↔ Runtime Integration Survey  
**Status:** 🔴 RED

#### Purpose
Verify that Ripple Intelligence integrates cleanly with **existing runtime enforcement
and merge gate mechanisms**, without overlap, contradiction, or authority leakage.

#### Scope (Survey Only)
- Map ripple planes to:
  - runtime enforcement points
  - CI and merge gate semantics
- Confirm ripple does NOT:
  - bypass CI
  - bypass gate merges
  - introduce soft enforcement
- Identify:
  - overlaps
  - gaps
  - future integration seams

#### Explicit Constraints
- ❌ No behavior changes
- ❌ No enforcement
- ❌ No CI changes
- ❌ No runtime changes
- ❌ No automation

#### Deliverable
- Evidence-based Ripple ↔ Runtime Compatibility Survey
- Conscious acceptance or flagged risks
- Readiness signal for future waves

(This survey follows the same discipline as prior FL/CI detectability surveys.)

## RIPPLE-WAVE 3 — FM / MATURION BROKERING (FUTURE)

### Objective
Prepare for a future state where **Maturion is always awake** and brokers ripple
awareness and coordination across repositories.

---

### 🔹 RIPPLE-WAVE 3.1 — Brokered Ripple Flow Design  
**Status:** 🔴 RED

**Planned**
- Define Maturion as ripple broker
- Define downward, upward, and lateral ripple flows
- Design-only (no execution, no automation)

---

## GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- No automatic modification of files
- No silent enforcement
- No bypass of One-Time Build Law
- No substitution of human responsibility with automation
- Automation only after correctness is proven

---

## RATCHET STATEMENT

We do not automate awareness until awareness is correct.  
We do not automate action until action is governed.  
We do not automate governance until drift is impossible.

Ripple Intelligence is introduced once — deliberately — and then relied upon.
