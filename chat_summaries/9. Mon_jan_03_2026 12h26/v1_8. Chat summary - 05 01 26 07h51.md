# 📌 MASTER CHAT HANDOVER SUMMARY  
**Project:** Maturion / Foreman App / Governance  
**User:** Johan Ras (CS2 / Bootstrap Executor)  
**Purpose:** Preserve execution continuity across chat switch  
**Status:** Wave 1 CLOSED (with IBWR applied) → Preparing Wave 2  

---

## 1️⃣ Why This System Is Unique (Read This First)

This is **not a normal software project**.

The system is deliberately designed to:
- Enforce **full AI autonomy** under governance
- Avoid coder-centric workflows and “hero debugging”
- Avoid iterative *fix-forward* development
- Preserve **One-Time Build (OPOJB / OPOJD)** correctness
- Strictly separate **authority, execution, and enforcement**

### Bootstrap Reality
Full automation (Maturion) is not yet deployed, therefore:

- **Johan acts as CS2 (mechanical runner only)**
- Johan does **NOT** give technical instructions
- All execution authority flows through **FM (Foreman)**
- Builders never take direction from Johan
- Human intervention exists **only to bridge tooling/platform limits**

This is **intentional, temporary, and governed**.

---

## 2️⃣ Core Philosophy & Concepts (Non-Negotiable)

### 🔒 One-Time Build (OPOJB / OPOJD)
- A unit of work is built **once**
- No partial progress states
- No “almost done”, “93%”, or “flaky but OK”
- Only terminal states are allowed:
  - **COMPLETE**
  - **BLOCKED**
- Anything else = governance failure

### 🧭 True North
- Governance correctness > speed
- Auditability > convenience
- Structural prevention > human memory

### 🌊 Ripple Effect
All changes must **ripple downward**:
Governance → FM Contract → Builder Contracts → Execution

markdown
Copy code
Nothing is assumed to propagate automatically.

### 🧠 AI Autonomy (With Accountability)
- FM is autonomous execution authority
- FM authors plans, issues, and instructions
- Builders execute strictly under FM
- Governance agents analyze and ratchet learning
- Automation assists awareness, **never replaces authority**

## 3️⃣ Repositories You MUST Understand

### 🔹 `maturion-foreman-governance` (PRIMARY TRUTH)
This repo defines **authority and law**.

Critical locations:
- `governance/canon/`
  - Tier-0 / Tier-1 governance
  - One-Time Build doctrine
  - FM authority models
- `BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md`
  - **Mandatory reading**
  - All real execution failures & learnings live here
- **PR #867**
  - Introduced **In-Between Wave Reconciliation (IBWR)**

👉 This repo explains **why** things must happen.

---

### 🔹 `maturion-foreman-office-app` (EXECUTION SURFACE)
This is where FM and builders operate.

Critical files:
- `.github/agents/ForemanApp-agent.md`
  - FM authority, escalation, halt semantics
- `.github/agents/*-builder.md`
  - Builder obligations, terminal state rules, code checking
- `WAVE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`
  - Canonical execution record
- Long-lived PRs (e.g. #373, #377, #379)
  - Used as execution workbenches

👉 This repo shows **how** governance is applied.

## 4️⃣ What Happened in Wave 1 (Condensed)

Wave 1 completed under stress.

### Problems Encountered
- Builder mindset drift (progress vs terminal states)
- Missing mandatory code checking
- AI escalation existed but was **not operational**
- Progress recording was implicit, not mandatory
- Long-lived PR instability fragmented artifacts

### Correct Actions Taken
- Execution was halted when violations appeared
- Root causes were analyzed (not blamed on builders)
- Governance gaps identified as **design gaps**
- **IBWR executed**
- Governance corrected *before proceeding*

---

## 5️⃣ Major Governance Corrections Implemented

### ✅ In-Between Wave Reconciliation (IBWR)
- Mandatory step between waves
- Blocks next wave authorization
- Captures failures, near-misses, corrections
- Introduced in governance **PR #867**

### ✅ AI Escalation & Capability Scaling (ACTIVE)
FM can now:
- Escalate **vertically** (model strength)
- Escalate **horizontally** (capability class)
- **HALT proactively** on complexity limits

**HALT ≠ FAILURE**  
HALT = governance-correct action.

### ✅ Mandatory Builder Code Checking
Builders must:
- Self-check code
- Provide evidence
- Cannot assume later review

Binding in:
- Builder contracts
- FM contract
- Governance specs

### ✅ Progress Recording Recognized as Governance Gap
- Reconstruction was possible but costly
- Escalated as bootstrap learning
- Governance fix queued for layer-down

---

## 6️⃣ Current State

### ✅ Wave 1
- Execution: **COMPLETE**
- IBWR: **COMPLETE**
- Progress reconstructed and recorded
- PRs merged to stabilize history (e.g. PR #379)

### 🔄 Transitional
- Wave 2 has **not started**
- System intentionally paused to harden next wave

---

## 7️⃣ What Must Happen Next

### 🔹 Issue A — IBWR Consolidation Confirmation
FM confirms:
- IBWR is complete
- No unresolved gaps
- Wave 1 is definitively closed

### 🔹 Issue B — Wave 2 Plan Alignment
FM must:
- Re-evaluate Wave 2 plan using Wave 1 learnings
- Explicitly address:
  - Workload per builder
  - Gate density
  - Escalation thresholds
  - Progress recording points
- Certify readiness

**Wave 2 MUST NOT start without this.**

---

## 8️⃣ Johan’s Role (CS2)

Johan:
- Runs GitHub mechanics
- Pastes FM instructions
- Merges only when FM authorizes
- Intervenes only when tooling blocks autonomy

Johan does **not**:
- Design solutions
- Direct builders
- Override FM

This constraint is **by design**.

---

## 9️⃣ Instructions to the New Assistant

You must:

1. Read:
   - `BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md`
   - Governance PR #867
   - `WAVE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`
2. Respect:
   - One-Time Build discipline
   - FM authority supremacy
   - No coder-centric shortcuts
3. Assist with:
   - Governance-correct issue drafting
   - FM instruction drafting
   - Alignment and sanity checks
4. Never:
   - Suggest quick fixes
   - Encourage iteration
   - Bypass FM authority

---

## 10️⃣ Bottom Line

This system **worked because failures were surfaced**, not hidden.

Wave 1 was hard **by design**.  
Wave 2 should be **structurally safer**.

This is not a reset — it is a **continuation of a governed autonomous system**.
