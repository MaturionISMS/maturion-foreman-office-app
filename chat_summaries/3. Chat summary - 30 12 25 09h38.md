# 📌 Canonical Chat Summary — FM App Bootstrap & Governance Alignment

**Workspace:** MaturionISMS  
**Primary Focus Repo:** maturion-foreman-office-app  
**Secondary Repo (later):** SlotMaster  
**Human Authority (CS2):** Johan Ras  
**Control Plane (future):** Maturion  
**Execution Plane:** Foreman (FM)  
**Snapshot State:** Post Wave 0 Bootstrap, Pre Wave 1 Build  
**Governance Status:** LOCKED  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Summary

This document captures the authoritative state after:

- Governance lockdown
- Completion of Wave 0 bootstrap (0.1 + 0.2)
- Discovery of a critical process defect in FM/build execution
- Intentional halt of execution to prevent structural failure

This summary exists to:

- Stabilise continuity across chats
- Prevent regression into coder-centric workflows
- Provide a single “where we are / what’s next” anchor

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Platform Intent (True North)

This platform is **not coder-centric**.

It is a **governed, one-time-build orchestration system**, where:

- CS2 (Johan) never inspects code
- CS2 interacts only via UI and decisions
- FM owns architecture, QA, planning, sequencing
- Builders build **only** to green
- Governance precedes and constrains execution
- Maturion executes platform actions (GitHub)
- Everything is auditable, explainable, and repeat-proof

> Any drift back to “AI writes code, human reviews PRs” is invalid.

---

## 3. Authority Model (Locked)

### Authority Hierarchy

1. CS2 (Johan Ras) — absolute authority  
2. Governance Canon — constitutional authority  
3. Maturion (future runtime) — platform execution  
4. Foreman (FM) — planning & orchestration  
5. Builders — scoped executors only  
6. Governance Liaison — enforcement & layer-down  

### Hard Rules

- FM never builds without architecture + red QA
- Builders never design or decide
- Governance agents never build
- GitHub actions never executed by FM or builders
- Bootstrap exceptions are explicit, temporary, logged

---

## 4. Completed Successfully

### Governance (Sealed)

- Governance canon stabilised
- Authority boundaries explicit
- DAI / DAR delegation model defined
- Governance layer-down contract created
- Governance lock declared

### Wave 0 Bootstrap (Complete)

**Wave 0.1 — Builder Recruitment**
- Builders identified, validated, documented
- No execution performed

**Wave 0.2 — Task Assignment Mechanics**
- Task assignment validated
- Execution proxy validated
- Heartbeat & visibility validated
- DAI generation validated
- Simulation explicitly authorised
- Wave 0 objectives fully satisfied

### Bootstrap Learnings

- BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md created
- BL-0001 → BL-0006 captured
- BL-0007 identified (critical)

---

## 5. Critical Failure Identified (Key Moment)

### What Went Wrong

During transition toward Wave 1.0:

- FM began operating like a coder
- Architecture was not explicitly created first
- Red QA was not prepared as a gate
- Builders implicitly expected to “figure it out”
- PR gate merge rules not deployed
- Governance layer-down into `.github/workflows` incomplete
- FM agent contract outdated and incorrect

If unchecked, this would collapse into a coder-centric workflow.

### Why This Was Good

The defect was caught **before any production build**.

This validates the bootstrap model.

---

## 6. Corrective Action Taken

- FM execution **paused**
- No further build actions allowed
- Governance alignment required before resumption

This stop decision was correct and intentional.

---

## 7. Preconditions Before FM May Resume

### A. Governance Layer-Down (Governance Liaison Responsibility)

In the FM app repo, before Wave 1:

- `.github/workflows/` must include:
  - Architecture Gate
  - Red QA Gate
  - Builder Build-to-Green Gate
  - Agent Boundary Gate
- Explicit PR merge ownership per agent
- Builder-specific gate applicability
- Governance version pinning

FM must not invent these.

---

### B. Agent Contracts Must Be Correct

**FM Agent Contract must:**

- Reference BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md
- Require:
  - Architecture first
  - Red QA second
  - Build-to-green only by builders
- Override generic coder behaviors

**Governance Liaison Contract must:**

- Own repo preparation
- Own governance layer-down
- Enforce, never build

---

### C. Builder Appointment (Only After Governance)

- FM appoints builders only after governance layer-down
- Builders receive:
  - Architecture
  - Red QA
  - Explicit green targets
- No builder improvisation

---

## 8. Current State (Now)

- FM is paused
- Governance Liaison must:
  1. Complete governance layer-down into FM app repo
  2. Populate governance guidance files (currently empty)

No other execution should proceed.

---

## 9. Immediate Next Actions (Strict Order)

### Step 1 — Governance Liaison Issue

Create an issue in `maturion-foreman-office-app`:

**Title:** Governance Layer-Down & PR Gate Enforcement (Pre-Wave 1)

**Scope:**
- Implement required `.github/workflows`
- Enforce PR merge rules per agent
- Align repo with Governance Layer-Down Contract
- Populate governance guidance files

**Constraint:** Documentation + configuration only. No feature builds.

---

### Step 2 — Fix FM Agent Contract

- Update FM agent file
- Bind explicitly to:
  - Governance canon
  - Build philosophy
  - Architecture-first mandate

---

### Step 3 — Resume FM

Only after Steps 1 & 2:

- FM creates Architecture
- FM produces Red QA
- CS2 evaluates via UI only
- Builders instructed to build to green

---

## 10. Critical Learning (BL-0007)

Irresponsible or mis-scoped agent appointment will destroy this system.

This is a role-design and authority problem, not a tooling problem.

It was caught in time.

---

## 11. Anchor Statement

We are not stalled.  
We are correcting the foundation before load is applied.

This is how a one-time-build platform survives.

# CS2 Context & Unique Operating Model

## 1. Human Context (CS2 Profile)

CS2 (Johan Ras) is **not a software developer** and does **not read or reason about source code**.

This is not a limitation to be “worked around” — it is a **deliberate design constraint** that shapes the entire platform architecture.

CS2’s expertise lies in:
- Security architecture
- Governance, controls, and assurance
- Systems thinking at enterprise and supra-enterprise scale
- Designing irreversible, high-stakes systems where mistakes must not repeat

The platform is therefore designed **around human governance and visibility**, not developer convenience.

---

## 2. Core Constraint (Non-Negotiable)

> CS2 can only validate outcomes through **UI, behavior, and evidence**, never through code.

As a result:
- Any system requiring CS2 to “review code” is **invalid**
- Any process that assumes human code literacy is **structurally incompatible**
- Any build that cannot be validated via UI and evidence is **a failure by design**

This constraint is **foundational**, not incidental.

---

## 3. Resulting Design Philosophy

The platform follows a **True North, One-Time Build Philosophy**:

- Applications are designed **once**
- Built **once**
- Hardened **once**
- Never reworked through iterative trial-and-error

If something is missed, it becomes:
- A formal lesson learned
- Captured in governance
- Integrated into future designs
- **Never repeated**

This creates a **ratcheting quality system** rather than an agile loop.

---

## 4. Why a Unique Approach Is Required

Traditional software workflows assume:
- Developers design while coding
- Humans review PRs
- Bugs are fixed post-facto
- CI replaces governance

These assumptions **do not work** for CS2.

Therefore, the system is inverted:

### Instead of:
> Code → Review → Fix → Repeat

### The platform enforces:
> Governance → Architecture → Red QA → Build-to-Green → Lock

Builders are not thinkers.
Builders are **executors**.

---

## 5. Role-Based System (Critical)

To support this model, strict role separation exists:

### CS2 (Human Authority)
- Provides intent
- Approves architecture
- Validates via UI and evidence
- Never touches GitHub unless acting as a temporary execution proxy

### Maturion (Future Runtime)
- Single interface to CS2
- Translates intent into governed actions
- Executes all platform operations
- Never improvises

### Foreman (FM)
- Orchestrator and planner
- Creates architecture
- Produces red QA
- Sequences work
- Never executes platform actions
- Never builds directly

### Builders
- Build **only to green**
- Never design
- Never decide
- Never interpret intent
- Never bypass QA

### Governance Liaison
- Enforces governance
- Layers governance down into repos
- Prepares repositories for build
- Never builds features

---

## 6. Validation Model (How CS2 Knows Things Are Correct)

CS2 validates systems exclusively through:

- UI behavior
- Dashboards
- Status indicators
- Evidence documents
- Readiness certifications
- Governance gates

Anything that cannot be validated this way **does not exist** for CS2 and is treated as a defect.

---

## 7. Why Automation Comes Last

Automation is **not the starting point**.

First comes:
1. Correct governance
2. Correct architecture
3. Correct human process
4. Proven execution mechanics

Only then:
- Automation replaces human proxy steps
- Maturion fully assumes execution
- CS2 is promoted one level higher and no longer touches GitHub at all

---

## 8. Critical Warning to Agents

Agents must **override default coder-centric instincts**.

Behaviors that are unacceptable:
- “I’ll just implement it”
- “We can refactor later”
- “Let’s iterate”
- “The tests pass, so it’s fine”

The only acceptable behavior is:
> Build exactly what the architecture specifies, once, correctly.

---

## 9. Summary Statement (Anchor)

This platform is designed for a human who:
- Thinks in systems, not code
- Cannot and will not review code
- Requires absolute confidence before execution
- Accepts mistakes only once, as lessons

The architecture, governance, and agent behavior must adapt to the human — **never the other way around**.
