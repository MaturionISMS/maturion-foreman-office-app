# 🔧 MATURION PLATFORM READINESS & BUILD EXECUTION PLAN  
## Execution-Accurate, Ratcheted, Bootstrap-Aware

Grounded in:
- Governance Canon v2.0+
- BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md (BL-009 → BL-016)
- One-Time Build / True North Philosophy

---

## PURPOSE

Establish a **deterministically governed, non-coder build system** capable of:

- One-time build correctness
- Autonomous agent execution
- Zero test debt / zero text debt
- No human interpretation at runtime
- Full traceability from governance → architecture → QA → builders

This plan explicitly rejects conventional coder workflows.

**Deliverable:**  
- `TSP_02_BUILDER_RECRUITMENT_CANON_VERIFICATION.md`

**Outcome:**  
- Governance canon for builder recruitment is **explicit, complete, and sufficient**
- Canon defines:
  - Canonical location: `.github/agents/<builder-role>.md`
  - Normative schema: `.agent.schema.md`
  - Recruitment semantics: `AGENT_RECRUITMENT.md`
  - Deterministic enforcement rules
- Phase 4.5 failure classified as **execution non-compliance**, NOT canon deficiency

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Severity:** 🔴 CATASTROPHIC FAILURE — ANALYZED & CLASSIFIED

---

### 4.6.2 FM App Builder Layer-Down Verification
**Owner:** Governance Agent  
**Deliverable:**  
- `FM_APP_BUILDER_LAYER_DOWN_SURVEY.md`

**Outcome:**  
Identified **4 critical layer-down gaps**:
1. Builder contracts not located in `.github/agents/`
2. Builder contracts lack machine-readable YAML prefaces
3. FM agent contract does not reference `.github/agents/` as authoritative
4. No automated builder discovery / recruitment mechanism

**Verdict:** ❌ LAYER-DOWN INCOMPLETE  
**Classification:** Phase 4.5 Canon Violation (Execution Failure)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (DIAGNOSTIC ONLY)

---

### 4.6.3 Builder Governance Submission Survey (Exhaustive)

---

## 🔴 CURRENT BLOCKER — PHASE 4.7 REQUIRED

### PHASE 4.7 — BUILDER GOVERNANCE LAYER-DOWN & CONTRACT REALIGNMENT
**Severity:** 🔴 CATASTROPHIC IF SKIPPED  
**Blocks:** Phase 5.0 Build Execution

This phase **does NOT rewrite builder intent**.
It **preserves all existing high-quality builder content** and makes it:
- Canonical
- Machine-discoverable
- Constitutionally enforceable
- Automation-ready

---

### 4.7.1 Governance → FM Layer-Down Instruction
**Owner:** Governance Agent  
**Purpose:** Remove all ambiguity for FM

**Deliverable:**  
- `FM_LAYERDOWN_BUILDER_RECRUITMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md`

**Content MUST Specify (Non-Negotiable):**
- `.github/agents/` as the ONLY canonical builder location
- Mandatory YAML preface fields (authoritative subset of `.agent.schema.md`)
- Required governance submission sections per builder
- Explicit declaration that root-level builder contracts are NON-CANONICAL
- STOP conditions for non-compliance

**Status:** ⛔ NOT STARTED

---

### 4.7.2 Builder Contract Canonicalization (Preserve + Convert)
**Owner:** FM Agent  
**Repo:** maturion-foreman-office-app

**Required Actions:**
- Move builder contracts to `.github/agents/<builder-role>.md`
- Add machine-readable YAML preface (authority, governance binding, lifecycle)
- Preserve existing markdown behavioral doctrine verbatim
- Validate contracts against `.agent.schema.md`
- Update FM agent contract to explicitly reference `.github/agents/` as authoritative

**Status:** ⛔ NOT STARTED

---

## 🔒 PHASE 4.7.3 — AUTOMATION RATCHET (NO FUTURE REGRESSION)

**Owner:** Governance + FM (Single Work Unit)  
**Nature:** Preventive / Future-State Enforcement  
**Current Status:** 🅿️ DESIGNED — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION

---

### Purpose
Ensure that the Phase 4.5 / 4.7 class of failure **can NEVER recur** by making builder governance enforcement:

- Automatic
- Machine-enforced
- Merge-blocking
- Drift-resistant

This phase is **not remediation**.
It is **permanent hardening**.

---

### Ratchets to Be Implemented (When Authorized)
- **Builder Recruitment Gate**
  - No execution unless a canonical, validated builder contract exists
- **CI Pre-Merge Validation Gate**
  - Builder contracts must validate or merge fails
- **Coupling Rule**
  - Governance changes REQUIRE schema + validator updates in the same PR

Design reference:
- `ENFORCEMENT_DESIGN_NOTE.md`

---

### Authorization Conditions (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Phase 4.7.3 may ONLY be authorized when ALL of the following are true:

1. Phase 4.7.2 is COMPLETE
   - Builder contracts canonicalized
   - Builders selectable and assignable
2. FM Build Execution has STARTED (Wave 1.0)
3. Bootstrap execution constraints are lifted or explicitly reduced
4. No corrective execution remains pending

Until these conditions are met:
- Automation ratchets MUST remain parked
- No CI coupling or merge-blocking rules may be introduced

---

### Explicit Governance Position
- This phase is **mandatory**, not optional
- This phase is **sequenced**, not immediate
- Skipping this phase is forbidden
- Executing this phase prematurely is forbidden

---

### Ratchet Statement
We do not automate ambiguity.  
We automate only after correctness is proven.

Phase 4.7.3 will be executed once — and only once — at the correct time.

---

## 🔒 UPDATED BLOCKER STATEMENT

# 🔨 PHASE 5.0 — BUILD EXECUTION (BOOTSTRAP MODE)

## Context
FM App automation is not yet live.  
During this phase, **CS2 performs the FM runtime role** while strictly enforcing FM behavior.

This phase **simulates the final automated execution loop** and must be executed with identical discipline.

---

## Execution Model (Bootstrap)

### Roles
- **FM (Agent):** Orchestrator and planner
- **CS2 (Human):** Temporary FM runtime / executor
- **Builders:** Autonomous executors within defined sandbox
- **Advisor (This Chat):** Verification, feedback, ratchet enforcement

---

## Execution Loop (Authoritative)

### Step 1 — FM Issues Build Assignments
FM SHALL:
- Execute his build execution plan
- Create **explicit GitHub issues** per assignment
- Each issue MUST specify:
  - Assigned builder agent
  - RED QA identifiers to be addressed
  - Build-to-Green obligation
  - Declared dependencies or sequencing constraints

FM then **sleeps**.

---

### Step 2 — CS2 Executes Assignments
CS2:
- Assigns the specified builder agents
- Monitors execution
- Collects resulting PRs

---

### Step 3 — Review & Feedback
For each completed assignment:
- CS2 provides implementation feedback to Advisor
- Advisor verifies:
  - Correctness
  - Scope adherence
  - QA resolution
- Advisor produces a **single feedback comment** that:
  - Approves or rejects the PR
  - Records wave completion
  - Explicitly instructs FM to issue the next wave

---

### Step 4 — Merge Control
- PRs are merged **only using the Advisor feedback comment**
- No independent merges
- Improvements are PARKED unless integrity-critical

---

### Step 5 — Wave Progression
- FM wakes upon feedback
- FM issues next wave assignment
- Loop repeats

---

## Finalization (End of Phase 5.0)

Only after the **final wave**:
1. FM performs a **full build and implementation inspection**
2. FM issues a **Final Build Sign-Off Certificate**
3. Only then is the final PR merged

---

## Constraints
- No partial waves
- No speculative execution
- No silent scope changes
- No test debt
- Build-to-Green is mandatory

---

## Ratchet Statement
Execution proceeds in waves.  
Feedback drives progression.  
Automation is rehearsed before it is enabled.
