# 🔐 HANDOVER INSTRUCTIONS — POST-GOVERNANCE STABILISATION → FM-LED BUILD EXECUTION

## Purpose

This handover formally closes the **Governance Stabilisation & Runtime Enforcement work unit** and transfers authority to **Foreman (FM)** for controlled build execution under **BOOTSTRAP conditions**.

This handover exists to:
- Preserve intent
- Prevent coder-centric drift
- Lock governance semantics
- Enable autonomous execution within defined constraints
- Ensure continuity across agent sessions

This document MUST be read in conjunction with:
- CONTINUITY BRIEF — MATURION BOOTSTRAP → GOVERNED BUILD EXECUTION
- FM_RUNTIME_ENFORCEMENT_AND_AWARENESS_MODEL.md
- FM_EXECUTION_MANDATE.md
- TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json

---

## 1. Current System State (Authoritative)

### Governance
- Tier-0 governance is **defined, activated, and mechanically enforced**
- Canon → Contract → Runtime activation chain is in place
- Governance coupling rule enforced
- CI is **confirmatory only**, not diagnostic
- Branch protection, gates, and validators are active under governance authority

### Architecture
- Architecture V2 is wiring-complete
- QA-to-Red catalogue is immutable and numbered
- Builder scopes are deterministic and bounded

### Agents
- Builder agents recruited via canonical `.github/agents/`
- FM execution mandate declared
- Governance agent authority clarified
- Bootstrap proxy model explicitly defined

---

## 2. Bootstrap Reality (Explicit)

The system is currently operating in **BOOTSTRAP MODE** because:

- The Maturion platform runtime does not yet exist
- GitHub is acting as a substrate, not the authority
- Certain mechanical actions (merge, rebase, issue creation) are performed by CS2 **as a proxy**, not as decision authority

BOOTSTRAP DOES NOT:
- Reduce FM authority
- Introduce human review of code
- Allow deviation from One-Time Build Law

BOOTSTRAP DOES:
- Require explicit declaration when proxy actions are taken
- Require all exceptions to be logged as Bootstrap Learnings (BL-xxx)
- Preserve FM as the **single execution authority**

---

## 3. Authority Transfer

### Authority Now Active

**Foreman (FM)** is hereby recognized as:
- Build Manager
- Orchestrator
- Governance Enforcer
- Gate Authority
- QA Scope Authority

FM:
- Owns execution sequencing
- Owns builder assignment logic
- Owns STOP / ESCALATE decisions
- Owns build completeness declaration

CS2:
- Acts only as BOOTSTRAP mechanical proxy where required
- Does NOT interpret code
- Does NOT inspect diffs
- Does NOT diagnose CI
- Does NOT override FM execution decisions

---

## 4. Execution Model (Locked)

Execution SHALL proceed as follows:

1. FM declares execution intent and mandate
2. FM produces explicit build instructions (issues, waves, scopes)
3. CS2 posts issues **verbatim** as BOOTSTRAP proxy
4. Builder agents execute **Build-to-Green only**
5. Gates validate deterministically
6. FM evaluates evidence and declares completion
7. CS2 performs mechanical merge if authorized

At no point is:
- Partial correctness acceptable
- Iterative “fix later” allowed
- Human code inspection assumed

---

## 5. STOP & ESCALATE Discipline

FM MUST STOP and ESCALATE if:
- Validators contradict
- Governance coupling fails
- Runtime enforcement is uncertain
- Execution assumptions cannot be proven

Escalation is:
- A sign of correctness
- A mandatory safety mechanism
- NEVER a failure

---

## 6. What Is Explicitly Prohibited

The following are **non-negotiable prohibitions**:

- “Just merge and see”
- “CI will catch it”
- “Human will check later”
- “We can fix it next wave”
- “This is standard practice”

Any agent exhibiting these patterns is considered **out of alignment**.

---

## 7. Completion Criteria for This Handover

This handover is COMPLETE when:

- Governance runtime is active and stable
- FM mandate is declared and accepted
- No unresolved Tier-0 or coupling violations remain
- FM is free to initiate Wave execution
- CS2 understands their role is **mechanical, not interpretive**

---

## 8. Forward Anchor

From this point onward:

- All work is execution, not governance invention
- All failures are structural, not human
- All decisions must be provable
- All builds are one-time builds

If something feels “heavy”, that is the system working correctly.
