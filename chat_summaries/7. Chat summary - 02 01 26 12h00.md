# 📌 CHAT SUMMARY — RIPPLE INTELLIGENCE EXECUTION (WAVES 1 → 2.2)  

## Timeframe
Governance Stabilisation → Ripple Intelligence Layer Implementation → Assisted Awareness Complete

---

## 1. Starting Position

- Governance stabilisation completed
- Tier-0 canon active and enforced
- FM mandate clarified and locked
- Bootstrap model active (CS2 as mechanical proxy only)
- No human code review, no iterative fixing, no coder-centric workflow

This aligns with the formal **Governance Stabilisation → FM-Led Build Execution Handover**.

---

## 2. Core Objective of This Phase

Introduce **Ripple Intelligence** as a **pre-execution awareness layer** that:

- Prevents silent drift
- Surfaces non-local impact
- Preserves One-Time Build Law
- Remains strictly subordinate to runtime enforcement
- Does NOT introduce automation, enforcement, or gate bypassing

Ripple ≠ Runtime  
Ripple = awareness  
Runtime = authority

---

## 3. Ripple-Wave 1 — Concept & Mindset (✅ COMPLETE)

### Ripple-Wave 1.1 — Concept Definition
- Ripple Intelligence Layer (RIL) defined as first-class governance concept
- Three planes established:
  1. Proactive Downward Ripple (pre-merge / pre-execution)
  2. Reactive Runtime Ripple (execution-time enforcement)
  3. Upward Learning Ripple (governance evolution)
- Ripple vs Runtime terminology reconciled

### Ripple-Wave 1.2 — Agent Mindset & Authority
- Agent Ripple Awareness Obligation canon created
- Explicit authority hierarchy locked:
  - Maturion (first-level authority)
  - Governance Agent (canon steward)
  - FM (execution authority)
  - All other agents (no self-mutation)
- FM responsibility for downstream agent coherence formalized
- Draft ripple language prepared but PARKED
- No `.agent` files auto-modified

Outcome:
> Agents now assume **non-local impact by default**.

---

## 4. FM Contract Stabilisation (✅ COMPLETE)

Before operationalising ripple:

- FM contract was corrected to distinguish:
  - **Authorship vs mechanical execution**
  - FM autonomy vs Maturion execution brokering
- FM authors all issues/PRs; Maturion/CS2 executes mechanically
- Explicit **Ripple Intelligence Responsibility** added to FM contract:
  - FM must receive, interpret, and act on ripple context
  - FM must update downstream agents or escalate
  - FM must never self-mutate or bypass governance

This step was critical to avoid ripple without ownership.

## 5. Ripple-Wave 2 — Assisted Awareness (NO ENFORCEMENT)

### Ripple-Wave 2.1 — Local Assisted Ripple Scan (✅ COMPLETE)

Delivered:
- Assisted ripple scan scope canon
- Ripple scan report schema
- Ripple scan report template
- Human review semantics canon
- Informational only; conscious acceptance allowed

Key invariant:
> Visibility without obligation.

---

### Ripple-Wave 2.2 — Passive Cross-Repository Awareness (✅ COMPLETE)

Delivered:
- Ripple Signal schema (passive, informational)
- Ripple Signal template
- Cross-Repository Ripple Awareness Model
- Integration into Ripple Intelligence Layer
- Governance artifact inventory updated
- All enhancements explicitly PARKED

Critical properties:
- Signals are optional
- Silence is valid
- No enforcement
- No automation
- No authority transfer

Outcome:
> The system can now **see across repositories** without acting.

---

## 6. Alignment Check (CONFIRMED)

After reviewing all post-merge artifacts:
- No soft enforcement detected
- No runtime bypass created
- No coupling between ripple and merge gates
- No autonomous loops introduced

Ripple remains **Plane 1 awareness only**.  
Runtime remains **sole execution-time authority**.

---

## 7. Identified Next Step (APPROVED)

### Ripple-Wave 2.3 — Ripple ↔ Runtime Integration Survey (🔴 NOT STARTED)

Purpose:
- Verify clean separation and compatibility between:
  - Ripple Intelligence outputs
  - Existing runtime enforcement and merge gates

This is a **survey only**:
- No behavior change
- No CI change
- No runtime change
- Evidence-based mapping
- Similar discipline to prior FL/CI detectability surveys

Issue drafted and ready.

---

## 8. Current Status Snapshot

- Ripple-Wave 1: 🟢 COMPLETE
- Ripple-Wave 2.1: 🟢 COMPLETE
- Ripple-Wave 2.2: 🟢 COMPLETE
- Ripple-Wave 2.3: 🔴 READY TO START (survey only)

The system now has:
- Awareness
- Authority clarity
- Enforcement separation

But **no automation and no coupling**.

---

## 9. Key Architectural Invariant (Locked)

> Ripple Intelligence allows the system to *know*.  
> FM decides what to do.  
> Runtime decides what is allowed.

Automation may assist awareness in the future,  
but responsibility is never automated.
