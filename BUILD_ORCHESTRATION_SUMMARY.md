# Build Orchestration Summary - Build Wave 0

**Generated**: 2025-12-04 06:32:28
**Module**: PIT
**Build Wave**: 0
**Purpose**: Build Wave 0 - Orchestration System Validation

---

## Executive Summary

Build Wave 0 has been completed successfully. This was a dry-run designed to validate
the build orchestration system without generating actual production code.

### Key Statistics

- Build Plan Generated: ✓ Yes
- Build Tasks Generated: ✓ Yes
- Total Tasks: 14
- Total Phases: 5

---

## What Worked ✓

- ✓ Build planning script executed successfully
- ✓ Build plan JSON generated and validated
- ✓ Build task generation script executed successfully
- ✓ Build tasks JSON generated with proper structure
- ✓ Generated 14 build tasks across all builders
- ✓ Task structure includes all required fields
- ✓ Task dependencies properly defined (13 tasks with dependencies)
- ✓ QA gates defined for 14 tasks
- ✓ Tasks distributed across all 5 builder agents
- ✓ Build phases properly sequenced (5 phases)

---

## What Failed or Needs Improvement

### 🔴 Module Readiness

**Issue**: Module not ready for actual build

**Details**:
- Module status is NOT_READY, not READY
- Module completeness is only 15.4%

**Impact**: Cannot proceed to actual module construction

**Recommendation**: Complete missing architecture components before Build Wave 1

### ℹ️ Build Execution

**Issue**: Build Wave 0 is a dry-run - no actual code generated

**Details**:
- This is expected for Build Wave 0
- Focus is on orchestration validation

**Impact**: No production code generated

**Recommendation**: Proceed to architecture completion, then Build Wave 1

## Lessons Learned

1. Build orchestration system is functional and can generate plans and tasks
2. Task generation follows proper sequencing with schema → API → integration/UI → QA
3. Builder boundaries are respected in task assignment
4. Dependency tracking works correctly across phases
5. QA gates and acceptance criteria are properly defined for each task
6. Module readiness detection correctly identifies blockers
7. JSON schema validation ensures data integrity
8. PIT module at 15.4% completeness - significant architecture work needed
9. Architecture documents must be completed before actual build
10. Build Wave 0 successfully validates orchestration without code generation
11. Foreman can coordinate multiple builders through structured task definitions

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

- Review Build Wave 0 outputs with Johan
- Validate all JSON schemas are correct
- Confirm orchestration logic meets requirements
- Document any gaps or issues discovered

### Before Build Wave 1

- Finalize PIT architecture documents
- Complete PIT database schema design
- Complete PIT integration specifications
- Complete PIT frontend component map
- Set up test environment infrastructure
- Prepare CI/CD pipeline for module builds

### For Build Wave 1

- Select next module based on dependency graph
- Ensure selected module has 80%+ architecture completeness
- Activate actual builder agents for code generation
- Enable real-time QA validation
- Implement compliance checking in build pipeline
- Set up change record automation

### Long-term Improvements

- Develop automated architecture gap detection
- Implement real-time build progress dashboard
- Create builder performance metrics
- Establish continuous integration for ISMS modules
- Build knowledge base from build cycles
- Refine orchestration based on actual build data

## Go/No-Go Assessment for Build Wave 1

**Recommendation**: **GO_FOR_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETION**
**Confidence**: HIGH

### Reasoning

- ✓ Orchestration system functional
- ✗ Module not ready for build
- ℹ  Build Wave 0 is a dry-run for orchestration validation
- ℹ  Module construction requires architecture completion
- ✓ Proceed to complete PIT architecture before Build Wave 1

### Conditions for GO

The following conditions must be met before Build Wave 1:

- [ ] Complete missing architecture components
- [ ] Complete all missing PIT architecture documents
- [ ] Achieve minimum 80% architecture completeness
- [ ] Validate all architecture components
- [ ] Review and approve Build Wave 0 results
- [ ] Set up test environment

## Next Steps

1. Review this summary with Johan
1. Address any identified gaps or issues
1. Complete PIT architecture documents
1. Prepare for Build Wave 1 planning
