# Wave 1.0 Self-Audit and Gap Analysis

**Generated By:** Maturion Foreman (FM)  
**Date:** 2025-12-30  
**Authority:** CS2 Request (Comment #3699442666)  
**Purpose:** Evidence-based verification of Wave 1.0 execution against canonical artifacts

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding:** FM executed Wave 1.0 with **SIGNIFICANT ALIGNMENT GAPS** to pre-existing canonical artifacts.

**Root Cause:** FM treated builders as "pending appointment" when builders were **already canonically defined and recruited in Wave 0.1**.

**Impact:** Execution flow duplicated pre-existing builder definitions and created unnecessary appointment gates not present in canonical artifacts.

**Recommendation:** Acknowledge canonical builder status from Wave 0.1 and proceed with Phase 2 execution per BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md sequencing.

---

## 1. Canonical Inputs Re-Read (Evidence-Based)

### 1.1 Builder Definitions (PRE-EXISTING CANONICAL)

**File:** `foreman/builder-manifest.json`  
**Status:** CANONICAL (created before Wave 1.0)  
**Content:** Defines 5 builders with responsibilities and forbidden actions

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "agents": {
    "ui-builder": {
      "responsibilities": ["UI components", "layouts", "wizards"],
      "forbidden": ["backend logic", "cross-module logic"]
    },
    "api-builder": {
      "responsibilities": ["API endpoints", "handlers"],
      "forbidden": ["UI", "global state"]
    },
    "schema-builder": {
      "responsibilities": ["database schemas", "models"],
      "forbidden": ["UI", "integration routing"]
    },
    "integration-builder": {
      "responsibilities": ["module integrations"],
      "forbidden": ["UI", "schemas"]
    },
    "qa-builder": {
      "responsibilities": ["QA tests", "coverage"],
      "forbidden": ["architecture", "governance"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Finding:** Builder identities, roles, and responsibilities **were already defined canonically** before Wave 1.0.

---

### 1.2 Builder Initialization System (PRE-EXISTING CANONICAL)

**File:** `foreman/init_builders.py`  
**Status:** CANONICAL (created before Wave 1.0)  
**Purpose:** Initialize and validate builder agent registry

**File:** `foreman/BUILDER_INITIALIZATION.md`  
**Status:** CANONICAL (created before Wave 1.0)  
**Content:** Complete builder initialization process documentation

**Key Sections:**
- Builder Agents (5 agents listed)
- Configuration Files (manifest, capabilities, permissions)
- Initialization Process (validation script)
- Validation Checklist

**Finding:** Builder initialization system **was operational and documented** before Wave 1.0.

---

### 1.3 Builder Registry Report (WAVE 0.1 EVIDENCE)

**File:** `foreman/builder-registry-report.md`  
**Generated By:** `init_builders.py` during Wave 0.1  
**Status:** COMPLETE (19/19 checks passed, 0 errors, 0 warnings)  
**Date:** Generated during Wave 0.1 execution

**Summary:**
- Total Agents Registered: 5
- Specification Files Found: 5
- Validation Checks: 19
- Errors: 0
- Warnings: 0

**Registered Agents:**
1. ui-builder — ✓ VALIDATED
2. api-builder — ✓ VALIDATED
3. schema-builder — ✓ VALIDATED
4. integration-builder — ✓ VALIDATED
5. qa-builder — ✓ VALIDATED

**Status:** ✓ SUCCESS: All builder agents initialized and validated successfully

**Finding:** **All 5 builders were RECRUITED, VALIDATED, and READY in Wave 0.1.**

---

### 1.4 Wave 0.1 Deliverables (CANONICAL BUILDER RECRUITMENT)

**File:** `WAVE_0.1_BUILDER_RECRUITMENT_SPEC.md`  
**Date:** 2025-12-30 (Wave 0.1)  
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Primary Objectives:**
1. ✅ Builder Recruitment: Recruit all 5 builder agents from the builder manifest
2. ✅ Builder Validation: Validate builder configurations and specifications
3. ✅ Scope Lock: Define and freeze the scope for this bootstrap wave
4. ✅ Readiness Certification: Produce evidence that builders are ready

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All 5 builders recruited and validated
- ✅ Builder manifest confirmed accurate
- ✅ Builder specifications reviewed and approved
- ✅ Wave 0.1 scope documented and locked
- ✅ Evidence artifacts generated and audit-ready
- ✅ CS2 approval obtained for proceeding to next wave

**File:** `WAVE_0.1_READINESS_CERTIFICATION.md`  
**Status:** CS2 APPROVED (explicit in PR comments)

**File:** `WAVE_0.1_BUILDER_RECRUITMENT_REPORT.md`  
**Status:** COMPLETE with full validation evidence

**Finding:** **Wave 0.1 canonically COMPLETED builder recruitment with CS2 approval.**

---

### 1.5 Execution Sequencing (CANONICAL DEFINITION)

**File:** `BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md` Section III  
**Status:** CANONICAL (constitutional authority)

**Canonical Build Pipeline:**
1. **ARCHITECTURE** — frozen architecture as build target
2. **RED QA** — tests exist, executed, all RED
3. **BUILD TO GREEN** — implementation against RED tests
4. **VALIDATION** — all tests GREEN, criteria met
5. **MERGE** — integration to main

**Finding:** BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md **does NOT include "builder appointment" as a separate phase** between Architecture and QA-to-Red.

---

### 1.6 Foreman Execution Playbook (CANONICAL OPERATIONAL GUIDE)

**File:** `foreman/FOREMAN_EXECUTION_PLAYBOOK.md`  
**Status:** CANONICAL (Version 1.0.0, Authoritative Operational Guide)

**Section III.C: TASK Definition:**
> **Your Actions:**
> 1. Validate architecture exists and is complete
> 2. Validate QA exists and is RED
> 3. Create "Build to Green" instruction
> 4. Assign to appropriate builder
> 5. Monitor execution
> 6. Validate completion

**Finding:** Playbook assumes builders **already exist** and can be assigned tasks directly. No "appointment process" defined.

---

## 2. Builder Appointment Semantics Verification

### 2.1 Canonical Builder Status (EVIDENCE)

**Question:** Where are builder roles already defined?

**Answer:**
- **File:** `foreman/builder-manifest.json` (canonical definitions)
- **Status:** PRE-EXISTING (before Wave 1.0)
- **Validation:** `foreman/builder-registry-report.md` (5/5 validated, Wave 0.1)
- **Recruitment:** `WAVE_0.1_BUILDER_RECRUITMENT_SPEC.md` (COMPLETE)
- **CS2 Approval:** Wave 0.1 approval (PR comment history)

**Finding:** **Builders were ALREADY APPOINTED by design in Wave 0.1.**

---

### 2.2 Wave 1.0 Treatment of Builders (GAP IDENTIFIED)

**FM Actions in Wave 1.0:**
1. Generated builder issue specification with "Governance-Scoped Appointment" section
2. Stated: "No builder appointed at creation time"
3. Stated: "Appointment only after: issue review → acceptance → formal binding → explicit recording"
4. Created appointment gate not present in canonical BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Canonical Status:** Builders recruited and validated in Wave 0.1 (CS2 approved)
- **FM Treatment:** Treated builders as "pending appointment"
- **Gap:** FM duplicated/re-specified existing builder definitions
- **Impact:** Created unnecessary governance gate not in BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md

---

### 2.3 New Requirement vs. Canonical Definition (CONFLICT DETECTED)

**New Requirement (Comment):**
> "Builder Appointment (Governance-Scoped): Issue created on behalf of FM under bootstrap proxy authority. No builder appointed at creation time. Appointment only after: issue review → acceptance → formal binding → explicit recording."

**Canonical Definition (Wave 0.1 Complete):**
- Builders recruited: ✅ COMPLETE
- Builder validation: ✅ COMPLETE (19/19 checks)
- CS2 approval: ✅ OBTAINED
- Ready for task assignment: ✅ CONFIRMED

**Conflict:** New requirement contradicts canonical Wave 0.1 status where builders are already recruited, validated, and CS2-approved.

---

## 3. Implementation Sequence Integrity Verification

### 3.1 Canonical Sequence (BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md)

**Phase 1: ARCHITECTURE**
- **Artifact:** `docs/architecture/TRUE_NORTH_FM_ARCHITECTURE.md` v1.0
- **FM Action:** Compiled and validated architecture (Step 3)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE, CS2 APPROVED (frozen)
- **Evidence:** `WAVE_1.0_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS_REPORT.md`
- **Alignment:** ✅ MATCHED CANONICAL REQUIREMENT

**Phase 2: RED QA**
- **Requirement:** QA suite must exist, be executed, status RED
- **Artifact Expected:** Test suite (unit, integration, E2E) — all RED
- **FM Action:** Generated builder issue specification for qa-builder
- **Status:** ⏳ IN PROGRESS (awaiting CS2 proxy issue creation)
- **Evidence:** `WAVE_1.0_TASK_QA_RED_01_BUILDER_ISSUE_SPEC.md`
- **Alignment:** ✅ MATCHED CANONICAL REQUIREMENT (but with unnecessary appointment gate)

**Phase 3: BUILD TO GREEN**
- **Status:** ⏸️ BLOCKED (awaits Phase 2 completion per BUILD_PHILOSOPHY)
- **FM Action:** Not yet started (correctly following sequencing)
- **Alignment:** ✅ MATCHED CANONICAL REQUIREMENT

---

### 3.2 Steps Taken vs. Canonical Artifacts

**Step 1: App Description Review**
- **Artifact Used:** `APP_DESCRIPTION.md` v1.1 (PRE-EXISTING)
- **FM Action:** Reviewed and validated (no changes)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Alignment:** ✅ MATCHED — Used existing canonical artifact

**Step 2: Functional Requirements Validation**
- **Artifact Used:** `docs/functional/FM_FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md` v1.1.0 (PRE-EXISTING)
- **FM Action:** Reviewed and validated (no changes)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Alignment:** ✅ MATCHED — Used existing canonical artifact

**Step 3: Architecture Compilation & Completeness Validation**
- **Artifact Used:** `docs/architecture/TRUE_NORTH_FM_ARCHITECTURE.md` v1.0 (PRE-EXISTING)
- **FM Action:** Validated completeness, generated report
- **New Artifact:** `WAVE_1.0_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS_REPORT.md` (26 KB)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE, CS2 APPROVED
- **Alignment:** ✅ MATCHED — Validated existing canonical architecture, followed BUILD_PHILOSOPHY Phase 1

**Step 4: QA-to-Red Suite Creation (Phase 2)**
- **Artifact Generated:** `WAVE_1.0_TASK_QA_RED_01_BUILDER_ISSUE_SPEC.md` (20 KB)
- **FM Action:** Generated comprehensive builder issue specification
- **Status:** ⏳ AWAITING CS2 PROXY
- **Gap Identified:** Added "Governance-Scoped Appointment" section not present in canonical BUILD_PHILOSOPHY or Wave 0.1 builder recruitment
- **Alignment:** ⚠️ PARTIAL MATCH — Followed Phase 2 requirement but added non-canonical appointment gate

---

### 3.3 Sequence Integrity Summary

| Step | Canonical Required | FM Action | Artifact Used | Alignment |
|------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| 1. App Description | Review canonical app description | Reviewed APP_DESCRIPTION.md v1.1 | PRE-EXISTING | ✅ MATCHED |
| 2. Functional Requirements | Validate functional baseline | Validated FM_FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md v1.1.0 | PRE-EXISTING | ✅ MATCHED |
| 3. Architecture | Freeze canonical architecture | Validated TRUE_NORTH v1.0, generated completeness report | PRE-EXISTING + NEW REPORT | ✅ MATCHED |
| 4. QA-to-Red | Compile RED test suite (BUILD_PHILOSOPHY Phase 2) | Generated builder issue spec for qa-builder | NEW SPEC | ⚠️ PARTIAL — Added non-canonical appointment gate |
| 5. Build-to-Green | Implementation (Phase 3) | Not started (correctly blocked) | N/A | ✅ MATCHED |

**Finding:** Sequence integrity **MOSTLY ALIGNED** with one gap: unnecessary "governance-scoped appointment" gate added in Step 4.

---

## 4. Gap Analysis (Required Output)

### 4.1 Confirmed Alignments ✅

**1. Constitutional Hierarchy Respected**
- ✅ BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md treated as supreme authority
- ✅ APP_DESCRIPTION.md validated as authoritative product intent
- ✅ FM_FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md validated as functional baseline
- ✅ TRUE_NORTH_FM_ARCHITECTURE.md validated as canonical architecture

**2. BUILD_PHILOSOPHY Phase Sequencing Followed**
- ✅ Phase 1 (Architecture) completed before Phase 2
- ✅ Architecture frozen with CS2 approval before QA-to-Red
- ✅ No implementation planning before QA-to-Red (Phase 3 correctly blocked)
- ✅ Canonical 5-phase pipeline structure maintained

**3. Canonical Artifacts Used**
- ✅ Used PRE-EXISTING APP_DESCRIPTION.md (not recreated)
- ✅ Used PRE-EXISTING FM_FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md (not recreated)
- ✅ Used PRE-EXISTING TRUE_NORTH_FM_ARCHITECTURE.md (not recreated)
- ✅ Validated existing artifacts rather than inventing new ones

**4. Evidence Generation Appropriate**
- ✅ Generated architecture completeness report (new, required)
- ✅ Generated builder issue specification (new, required for CS2 proxy)
- ✅ All evidence traceable to governance frameworks

**5. Authority Boundaries Respected**
- ✅ FM did not execute GitHub platform operations (correctly avoided)
- ✅ FM did not implement code (correctly avoided)
- ✅ FM requested CS2 proxy for GitHub operations (correct protocol)
- ✅ FM did not modify frozen architecture without governance authorization

### 4.2 Detected Gaps and Failures ❌

**Gap #1: Builder Recruitment Canonical Status Not Recognized**

**What Happened:**
- FM treated builders as "pending appointment" in Wave 1.0 Phase 2
- Generated builder issue specification with "Governance-Scoped Appointment" section
- Created appointment gate: "No builder appointed at creation time"

**What Should Have Happened:**
- Recognize builders were **already recruited and validated in Wave 0.1**
- Reference Wave 0.1 builder recruitment completion as canonical status
- Proceed directly to task assignment per BUILD_PHILOSOPHY Phase 2

**Evidence of Canonical Status:**
- `foreman/builder-manifest.json` — Builders defined
- `foreman/builder-registry-report.md` — 5/5 builders validated (Wave 0.1)
- `WAVE_0.1_BUILDER_RECRUITMENT_SPEC.md` — Recruitment COMPLETE
- `WAVE_0.1_READINESS_CERTIFICATION.md` — CS2 APPROVED
- Wave 0.1 PR comments — CS2 explicit approval: "Wave 0.1 is APPROVED"

**Impact:**
- Duplicated builder definition work already completed in Wave 0.1
- Created unnecessary "appointment" gate not present in BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md
- Introduced ambiguity about builder readiness status

**Root Cause:**
- FM did not reference Wave 0.1 completion artifacts when starting Wave 1.0 Phase 2
- New requirement comment introduced "governance-scoped appointment" concept not present in canonical BUILD_PHILOSOPHY
- FM interpreted new requirement as mandatory without reconciling against Wave 0.1 canonical status

---

**Gap #2: Builder Appointment Process Not Canonical**

**What Happened:**
- Added "Governance-Scoped Builder Appointment" section to builder issue spec
- Defined appointment process: issue review → acceptance → formal binding → explicit recording
- Created gate condition: "No execution authorized until appointment complete"

**What Should Have Happened:**
- Build directly on Wave 0.1 builder recruitment (already CS2 approved)
- Follow BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md Phase 2 directly: assign QA-to-Red task to qa-builder
- No additional "appointment" step defined in canonical BUILD_PHILOSOPHY

**Evidence:**
- BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md Section III — 5 phases defined, no "appointment" phase
- Foreman Execution Playbook — Assumes builders exist, direct assignment
- Wave 0.1 artifacts — Builder recruitment already complete with CS2 approval

**Impact:**
- Created non-canonical governance gate
- Delayed Phase 2 execution with unnecessary process
- Contradicted Wave 0.1 completion status

**Root Cause:**
- New requirement in comment introduced concept not aligned with BUILD_PHILOSOPHY
- FM did not validate new requirement against canonical BUILD_PHILOSOPHY before implementation
- FM treated comment as authoritative without checking constitutional hierarchy

---

**Gap #3: Wave 0.1 Completion Not Referenced**

**What Happened:**
- FM generated Wave 1.0 artifacts without explicit reference to Wave 0.1 completion
- Did not cite `WAVE_0.1_READINESS_CERTIFICATION.md` as evidence of builder readiness
- Did not reference `foreman/builder-registry-report.md` as evidence of builder validation

**What Should Have Happened:**
- Begin Wave 1.0 Phase 2 specification with: "Building on Wave 0.1 builder recruitment (CS2 approved), builders are ready for task assignment"
- Reference Wave 0.1 deliverables as canonical evidence
- Acknowledge builders are recruited, validated, and ready per Wave 0.1 success criteria

**Evidence:**
- Wave 0.1 PR description explicitly states: "Wave 0.1: Builder Recruitment (APPROVED & COMPLETE)"
- Wave 0.1 success criteria ALL SATISFIED
- CS2 PR comments: "Wave 0.1 is APPROVED"

**Impact:**
- Lost continuity between Wave 0 and Wave 1.0
- Created impression builders were not yet ready
- Duplicated validation work

**Root Cause:**
- FM did not establish "what came before" when resuming Wave 1.0
- Context window limitation: Wave 0.1 artifacts not actively referenced
- No explicit instruction to "resume from Wave 0.1 complete status"

---

### 4.3 Misinterpretations or Contradictions

**Misinterpretation #1: Builder Readiness Status**

**Canonical Truth:**
- Builders recruited and validated in Wave 0.1 (COMPLETE)
- CS2 approved Wave 0.1 with explicit statement: "Builder recruitment and validation are complete"
- Builder registry report: "✓ SUCCESS: All builder agents initialized and validated successfully"

**FM Interpretation:**
- Builders "pending appointment"
- "No builder appointed at creation time"
- Appointment required before execution

**Contradiction:**
- Wave 0.1 canonical status (recruited, validated, CS2-approved) contradicts Wave 1.0 treatment (pending appointment)

---

**Misinterpretation #2: BUILD_PHILOSOPHY Phase 2 Requirements**

**Canonical Requirement (BUILD_PHILOSOPHY Section III Phase 2):**
> "Before any code is written, the QA suite must exist. Before any code is written, the QA suite must have been executed. Before any code is written, the QA status must be RED."

**FM Interpretation:**
- Correctly identified: QA suite must exist before implementation
- Correctly identified: QA suite must be RED
- **Added non-canonical requirement:** "Builder appointment" must occur before QA compilation

**Contradiction:**
- BUILD_PHILOSOPHY Phase 2 does not mention "builder appointment"
- Builder readiness is a **prerequisite** (satisfied in Wave 0), not a Phase 2 step

---

### 4.4 Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Acknowledge Wave 0.1 Builder Recruitment as Canonical**
   - Builders are recruited, validated, and CS2-approved per Wave 0.1
   - No additional "appointment" process required
   - Builders are ready for task assignment per BUILD_PHILOSOPHY Phase 2

2. **Remove Non-Canonical Appointment Gate**
   - Remove "Governance-Scoped Builder Appointment" section from builder issue spec
   - Replace with: "Building on Wave 0.1 builder recruitment (CS2 approved), qa-builder is assigned this task"
   - Acknowledge builder readiness status from Wave 0.1 canonical artifacts

3. **Proceed with Phase 2 Execution**
   - CS2 creates builder issue per specification (without appointment gate)
   - qa-builder assigned directly (per Wave 0.1 recruitment completion)
   - Phase 2 execution proceeds per BUILD_PHILOSOPHY sequencing

4. **Update Builder Issue Specification**
   - Revise `WAVE_1.0_TASK_QA_RED_01_BUILDER_ISSUE_SPEC.md`
   - Replace appointment section with Wave 0.1 recruitment reference
   - Maintain all other specification content (deliverables, acceptance criteria, forbidden actions)

**Governance Clarifications:**

1. **Builder Recruitment is Wave 0 Concern, Not Phase 2**
   - Builder recruitment: Wave 0.1 (COMPLETE, CS2 approved)
   - Architecture freeze: Phase 1 (COMPLETE, CS2 approved)
   - QA-to-Red: Phase 2 (IN PROGRESS, awaiting CS2 proxy)
   - Build-to-Green: Phase 3 (BLOCKED, awaits Phase 2)

2. **Appointment vs. Assignment**
   - **Appointment:** Builder recruitment into registry (Wave 0.1, COMPLETE)
   - **Assignment:** Builder given specific task (Phase 2+, per BUILD_PHILOSOPHY)
   - No additional "appointment" required after Wave 0.1

3. **New Requirements Must Align with BUILD_PHILOSOPHY**
   - Any new requirement must be validated against BUILD_PHILOSOPHY constitutional authority
   - New governance gates must be explicitly added to BUILD_PHILOSOPHY (not introduced ad-hoc)
   - Comment requirements cannot override canonical BUILD_PHILOSOPHY without constitutional amendment

---

## 5. Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

**Alignments:** ✅ 5 major alignments confirmed
- Constitutional hierarchy respected
- BUILD_PHILOSOPHY phase sequencing followed
- Canonical artifacts used (not recreated)
- Evidence generation appropriate
- Authority boundaries respected

**Gaps:** ❌ 3 gaps identified
- Builder recruitment canonical status not recognized
- Builder appointment process not canonical
- Wave 0.1 completion not referenced

**Misinterpretations:** ⚠️ 2 contradictions detected
- Builder readiness status (canonical vs. FM treatment)
- BUILD_PHILOSOPHY Phase 2 requirements (canonical vs. FM interpretation)

### Root Cause

**Primary:** FM did not establish continuity with Wave 0.1 completion when starting Wave 1.0 Phase 2.

**Contributing Factors:**
1. Context window limitation (Wave 0.1 artifacts not actively in context)
2. New requirement introduced non-canonical "appointment" concept
3. FM did not validate new requirement against BUILD_PHILOSOPHY constitutional authority

### Path Forward

**Corrective Actions:**
1. ✅ Acknowledge Wave 0.1 builder recruitment as canonical (builders ready)
2. ✅ Remove non-canonical appointment gate from builder issue specification
3. ✅ Update specification to reference Wave 0.1 completion
4. ✅ Proceed with Phase 2 execution per BUILD_PHILOSOPHY (CS2 proxy creates issue, qa-builder assigned)

**Preventive Measures:**
1. Always establish "what came before" when resuming work
2. Reference Wave/Phase completion artifacts explicitly
3. Validate new requirements against constitutional BUILD_PHILOSOPHY before implementation
4. Maintain continuity references across Wave boundaries
