## V. Key Features and Innovations

### 1. Constitutional Hierarchy

Clear precedence order:
1. Johan (Owner Override) - temporary, explicit
2. BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md - supreme authority
3. Agent Contracts - constitutional level
4. Governance Rules - enforcement level
5. Operational Docs - implementation level

### 2. Protected Paths Mechanism

Constitutional files are **NEVER MODIFIABLE** without CS2 approval:
- Automated protection
- Escalation required
- Owner approval needed
- Documented rationale required

### 3. Evidence Framework

Complete, structured evidence for every build:
- Templates standardize collection
- Mandatory for all builds
- Permanent audit trail
- Machine-readable (JSON) and human-readable (Markdown)

### 4. Pre-Build Validation

Multi-level validation BEFORE any build:
- Memory Fabric validation
- Architecture validation (11 sections)
- QA Suite validation (RED required)
- Integration validation
- Compliance validation

**If ANY fails → Build blocked**

### 5. Quality Gates

4-level enforcement:
1. Pre-commit (hooks)
2. CI/CD Pipeline (automated)
3. Pre-merge (Foreman validation)
4. Post-merge (runtime monitoring)

### 6. Zero Test Debt Enforcement

Comprehensive prohibition:
- 7 forms of test debt defined
- Detection → Stop → Fix → Verify → Continue
- Prevention strategies (hooks, CI/CD, Foreman)
- No deferrals, no exceptions

### 7. Owner Override with Automatic Reversion

Johan can override for emergencies:
- Temporary (specific instance only)
- Explicit (clearly stated)
- Automatic reversion (rules return immediately)
- Documented (evidence trail)
- Follow-up tracking (technical debt resolution)
