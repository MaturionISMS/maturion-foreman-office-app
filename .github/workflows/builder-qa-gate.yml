name: Builder QA Gate

# CI CLASSIFICATION: Hard Gate
# Purpose: Validates Builder QA Report presence, schema, and READY status
# Failure Semantics:
#   - Builder declares NOT_READY → Expected workflow → Block merge (trust builder)
#   - Schema invalid → Code failure → Block merge
#   - Infrastructure failures → Explicit infra-failure signal → Success + Comment
# Timeout: 10 minutes (simple validation only)
# See: .github/CI_CLASSIFICATION.md

              No Builder QA Report found in this PR.
              
              This is acceptable for:
              - **FM Repository** (uses FM QA, not Builder QA)
              - Documentation-only changes
              - Governance-only changes
              
              **For FM Repository**:
              - FM QA is validated via Build-to-Green Enforcement workflow
              - FM tests its own functionality (orchestration, enforcement, monitoring)
              - No external Builder QA required
              
              **For ISMS Module Repositories**:
              - Builder QA Report is mandatory
              - Must be generated by Builder agents
              - Must declare READY for merge

              - Wait for Builder to fix issues
              - Builder will declare READY when ready
              - Do NOT override Builder's decision
              
              **If schema invalid**:
              - Fix Builder QA Report structure
              - Follow canonical schema: governance/alignment/AGENT_SCOPED_QA_BOUNDARIES.md
              - Ensure all required fields present
              
              **If agent attribution incorrect**:
              - Verify report authored by builder agent
