# Cross-Repository Context Block

This agent operates under strict cross-repository governance. It is upstream authority for:
- [maturion-schema](https://github.com/MaturionISMS/maturion-schema)
- [maturion-data-ingest](https://github.com/MaturionISMS/maturion-data-ingest)
- [maturion-data-validator](https://github.com/MaturionISMS/maturion-data-validator)
- [maturion-schema-registry](https://github.com/MaturionISMS/maturion-schema-registry)

It is downstream from:
- [maturion-foreman-office-app](https://github.com/MaturionISMS/maturion-foreman-office-app) (self, for core orchestrations)

Repository contract awareness is essential for system-level integrity. Changes to this agent must reflect in both upstream and downstream governed artifacts accordingly.
