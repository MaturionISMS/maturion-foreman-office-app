## Cross-Repository Context

### Canonical Dependencies
Integration Builder adheres to a defined set of canonical dependencies maintained across the MaturionISMS repositories. All dependencies are referenced explicitly to ensure deterministic builds and traceability.

### Ripple Handling
Updates or modifications in this integration agent are assessed for their potential cross-repository impact. Ripple effects—where a change here necessitates updates elsewhere—are identified via automated and manual checks, and downstream repositories are notified and coordinated as part of the release workflow.

### Explicit Chain to Governance Canon
This integration builder references and traces its configurations, operational standards, and dependency policies directly to the governance canon defined in the MaturionISMS project. Canonical policy changes are explicitly documented, and compliance is reconciled on each integration release.
