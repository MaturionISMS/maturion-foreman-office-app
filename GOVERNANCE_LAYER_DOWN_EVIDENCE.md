**Size**: 32 KB  
**Template Version**: 2.0.0  
**Canon Version**: G-PLAT-READY-01 v2.0.0

**Content Summary**:
- Platform readiness validation checklist

- Deterministic validation methods (per Canon v2.0.0 Section 4)
- REQUIRED vs DEGRADABLE condition classification
- Operational vs defined validation requirements (BL-014)

- Added deterministic validation steps for all conditions
- Added operational vs defined distinction (enforcement proof required)
- Added AMBER restrictions (only DEGRADABLE conditions may be incomplete)

**Deviation**: NONE — Exact copy from canonical source

### 3. BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md (BL-010 through BL-014)

**Source**: `maturion-foreman-governance/governance/canon/BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md`  
**Destination**: `maturion-foreman-office-app/governance/canon/BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md`  
**Size**: 26 KB  
**Purpose**: Canonical bootstrap learnings including ratified BL-010 through BL-014

**Ratified Bootstrap Learnings** (effective 2025-12-31):

#### BL-010: Platform Readiness Requires Deterministic Validation
- **Type**: Governance Learning
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: All future platform readiness declarations
- **Learning**: Platform readiness conditions MUST be accompanied by deterministic validation methods with explicit evidence requirements. Readiness cannot be verified subjectively.
- **Status**: Recorded — Non-Retroactive

#### BL-011: Platform Readiness Must Distinguish Repository Scope
- **Type**: Governance Learning
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: All future platform readiness declarations
- **Learning**: Platform readiness MUST specify scope: governance repository only, specific application repository, or ecosystem-wide. Different scopes have different readiness criteria.
- **Status**: Recorded — Non-Retroactive

#### BL-012: AMBER Readiness Requires Explicit Exception Criteria
- **Type**: Governance Learning
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: All future AMBER readiness declarations
- **Learning**: AMBER readiness state MUST include explicit, non-subjective criteria for which conditions may be incomplete and under what circumstances. "Optional elements" must be enumerated constitutionally.
- **Status**: Recorded — Non-Retroactive

#### BL-013: Platform Readiness Must Model Progressive Activation
- **Type**: Governance Learning
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: All future platform readiness models and declarations
- **Learning**: Platform readiness MUST be modeled as progressive activation with explicit capability-based readiness stages. Different execution modes have different readiness prerequisites.
- **Status**: Recorded — Non-Retroactive

#### BL-014: "Operational" Requires Evidence of Enforcement, Not Just Existence
- **Type**: Governance Learning
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: All future operational readiness validations
- **Learning**: "Operational" governance MUST be proven through enforcement evidence, not existence evidence. Readiness requires proof governance has enforced (past tense), not proof governance could enforce (conditional).
- **Status**: Recorded — Non-Retroactive

**Deviation**: NONE — Exact copy from canonical source

**Size**: 57 KB  
**Canon ID**: G-PLAT-READY-01  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Effective Date**: 2025-12-31

**Content Summary**:

## Governance Canon Version Declaration

**Current Governance Canon Version**: v2.0.0  
**Effective Date**: 2025-12-31  
**Authority**: Platform Readiness Reset & Build Initiation Plan (Phase 2.1)

**Canonical Source**: `maturion-foreman-governance` repository  
**Layered Down To**: `maturion-foreman-office-app` repository  
**Layer-Down Method**: Direct file copy (consumptive, non-interpretive)

---

## Scope and Activation Metadata

Per Canon v2.0.0 requirements, governance layer-down includes explicit scope and activation metadata consumable by FM:

### Repository Scope
- **This Layer-Down Applies To**: Per-Repository (maturion-foreman-office-app)
- **Scope Type**: Application Repository
- **Governance Layer Status**: Governance artifacts layered down from governance repository to application repository

### Progressive Activation Stage
- **Stage**: Stage 2 prerequisite (Repository Ready)
- **Purpose**: Enable repository-level platform readiness evaluation
- **Next Stage Requirements**: Architecture frozen, QA-to-red complete, manual execution ready (Stage 3)

**Note**: This layer-down does NOT declare platform readiness. It layers down the governance artifacts required to **evaluate** platform readiness in Phase 3.

---

## Deviations from Canonical Governance

**Deviations**: **NONE**

All artifacts layered down are **exact copies** from the authoritative governance repository. No modifications, interpretations, or local variations were introduced.

**Verification Method**: File size comparison, content inspection

| Artifact | Source Size | Destination Size | Match |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| PHASE_2_1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md | 14 KB | 14 KB | ✅ EXACT |
| PLATFORM_READINESS_CHECKLIST.template.md | 32 KB | 32 KB | ✅ EXACT |
| BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md | 26 KB | 26 KB | ✅ EXACT |
| PLATFORM_READINESS_FOR_GOVERNED_BUILD_EXECUTION.md | 57 KB | 57 KB | ✅ EXACT |

---

## Not Included in This Layer-Down

**This layer-down does NOT include**:

- ❌ Platform readiness declaration or assessment
- ❌ Platform readiness evidence artifact creation
- ❌ FM inspection or platform state evaluation
- ❌ Workflow activation or modification
- ❌ Governance canon changes or updates
- ❌ Governance interpretation or tailoring
- ❌ Build authorization or execution initiation

---

## Governance Position After Layer-Down

**Phase 2.2 Status**: COMPLETE  
**Phase 3 Status**: BLOCKED (awaiting authorization for FM Platform Readiness Loop)  
**Build Initiation Status**: PAUSED

**Next Steps**:
- Phase 3 (FM Platform Readiness Loop) may proceed ONLY when explicitly authorized
- Platform readiness evaluation may be performed using layered-down canon v2.0.0
- No readiness declaration is authorized until Phase 3 completion

---

## Consumption Model

This layer-down is **consumptive and mechanical**, not interpretive.

FM agents and workflows MUST:
- ✅ Consume governance exactly as written in layered-down artifacts
- ✅ Apply deterministic validation methods per Canon v2.0.0 Section 4
- ✅ Declare repository scope and activation stage per Canon v2.0.0 requirements
- ✅ Reference canon version (v2.0.0) in all governance citations
- ❌ NOT interpret or modify governance requirements
- ❌ NOT create local variations or exceptions
- ❌ NOT weaken or bypass canonical rules
- ❌ NOT declare readiness without completing Phase 3 evaluation
