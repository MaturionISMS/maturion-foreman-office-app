## Notes

This repository underwent FPC layer-down from PARTIAL governance state to COMPLETE FPC-compliant state. 

The repository already had substantial governance infrastructure in place:
- Existing governance/ directory with policies, schemas, alignment docs
- Existing .github/agents/ with builder and FM contracts
- Existing .github/workflows/ with comprehensive gate workflows
- Existing memory/ system at root level

FPC layer-down added:
- `.architecture/` directory for initialization evidence
- `.qa/` directory for QA evidence
- `governance/evidence/` directory structure for commissioning
- `governance/alignment/GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT.md` for version tracking
- This initialization evidence file
- Canonical schemas reference document

Repository is now fully FPC-compliant and ready for continued operation under canonical Maturion governance.
