# Build Orchestration Readiness Report - Build Wave 1

**Generated**: 2025-12-04 06:52:00  
**Build Wave**: 1  
**Status**: PLANNING_COMPLETE  
**Execution Status**: AWAITING_APPROVAL

---

## Executive Summary

Build Wave 1 planning has been **successfully completed**. All orchestration systems are operational and ready for multi-module skeleton build execution pending Johan's approval.

### Key Achievements

- ✅ **11 modules** planned for skeleton build
- ✅ **88 skeleton build tasks** generated across all builders
- ✅ **55 build phases** defined with proper sequencing
- ✅ **Build dependency graph** created and validated
- ✅ **All governance checks** enforced

### Critical Issues

⚠️ **Circular Dependencies Detected**:
- WRAC ↔ PIT
- VULNERABILITY ↔ THREAT

These must be resolved through event-driven integration patterns before build execution.

⚠️ **Architecture Completeness**: Average 0% - All modules require architecture completion for full builds. Wave 1 proceeds with skeleton builds only.

---

## Build Wave 1 Overview

### Purpose

Establish the **full ISMS platform foundation skeleton** - including all module roots, core UI shells, routing, database scaffolding, API endpoint placeholders, and integration points.

This is a **skeleton build wave** - not full functional implementation. It creates the structural backbone that all future functionality will attach to.

### Modules Included (11 Total)

1. **PIT** – Project & Issue Tracker
2. **ERM** – Enterprise Risk Management  
3. **RISK_ASSESSMENT** – Risk Assessment Module
4. **THREAT** – Threat Module
5. **VULNERABILITY** – Vulnerability Module
6. **WRAC** – Workplace Risk Assessment & Controls
7. **COURSE_CRAFTER** – Course Development Module
8. **POLICY_BUILDER** – Policy Management Module
9. **ANALYTICS_REMOTE_ASSURANCE** – Analytics and Assurance
10. **AUDITOR_MOBILE_APP** – Mobile Auditor Application
11. **SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_PORTAL** – Skills Development Portal

## Multi-Module Readiness Assessment

### Module Status Summary

| Module | Completeness | Status | Dependencies | Tasks |
|--------|--------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| ANALYTICS_REMOTE_ASSURANCE | 0.0% | NOT_READY | None | 8 |
| AUDITOR_MOBILE_APP | 0.0% | NOT_READY | None | 8 |
| COURSE_CRAFTER | 0.0% | NOT_READY | None | 8 |
| POLICY_BUILDER | 0.0% | NOT_READY | None | 8 |
| SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_PORTAL | 0.0% | NOT_READY | None | 8 |
| PIT | 0.0% | NOT_READY | WRAC | 8 |
| WRAC | 0.0% | NOT_READY | PIT | 8 |
| ERM | 0.0% | NOT_READY | PIT, WRAC | 8 |
| RISK_ASSESSMENT | 0.0% | NOT_READY | ERM | 8 |
| THREAT | 0.0% | NOT_READY | VULNERABILITY | 8 |
| VULNERABILITY | 0.0% | NOT_READY | THREAT | 8 |

### Readiness Decision

**Build Readiness**: ⚠️ **READY FOR SKELETON BUILD** (with caveats)

**Notes**:
- All modules at 0% completeness is expected for Wave 1
- Skeleton builds can proceed to establish structure
- Full implementation requires architecture completion
- Circular dependencies noted but not blocking skeleton builds

---

## Go/No-Go Assessment

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ **GO FOR SKELETON BUILD** (with conditions)

**Confidence**: HIGH

### Conditions for GO

- ✅ Orchestration system functional
- ✅ Build plan generated and validated
- ✅ Tasks properly sequenced
- ✅ Governance checks enforced
- ⚠️ Circular dependencies noted (won't block skeleton builds)
- ⚠️ Architecture incomplete (expected for skeleton phase)
- ✋ **Johan approval required**

### Key Deliverables Generated

- `build-plan-wave-1.json` - Multi-module build plan
- `build-tasks-wave-1.json` - All skeleton build tasks (88 tasks)
- `build-status-wave-1.json` - Build status tracking
- `foreman/reports/BUILD_WAVE_1_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive summary

---

## Next Steps

1. ✋ **AWAITING JOHAN APPROVAL**: Review all Wave 1 outputs
2. **Resolve circular dependencies**: Update integration specs
3. **Set up test environment**: Prepare deployment infrastructure
4. **Obtain approval to proceed** with skeleton build execution
