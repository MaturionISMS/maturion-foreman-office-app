# Wave 0.2 — Controlled Task Assignment Dry Run
## Batch 3B (Bootstrap Execution Model)

**Date Generated:** 2025-12-30  
**Generated By:** Maturion Foreman (FM)  
**Execution Model:** Wave 0 Bootstrap (Manual, Governed)  
**Authority Chain:** CS2 (Johan) → FM → Builders  
**Status:** PLANNING_PHASE  
**Approved By CS2:** Wave 0.1 APPROVED, Wave 0.2 AUTHORIZED

---

## Executive Summary

Wave 0.2 validates the builder task assignment mechanics, execution proxy flow, and governance behavior under light execution pressure. This is a **controlled dry run** with minimal, reversible scope and **NO production implementation**.

**Purpose:** Validate orchestration mechanics before authorizing production work  
**Scope:** Minimal, reversible, documentation-only tasks  
**Risk:** Low (no production code changes)

---

## 1. CS2 Decision Context

### 1.1 CS2 Approval of Wave 0.1

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-12-30

**CS2 Findings:**
- Builder recruitment and validation complete
- Scope clearly defined and locked
- Governance and authority boundaries fully respected
- Evidence complete and audit-ready

### 1.2 CS2 Decision for Wave 0.2

**Decision:** Proceed with **Option A — Wave 0.2 (Controlled Task Assignment Dry Run)**

**Rationale (per CS2):**
> "Before initiating production implementation, I want to validate:
> - builder task assignment mechanics
> - execution proxy flow
> - governance behavior under light execution pressure"

**Constraints (unchanged):**
- FM remains planning and sequencing authority only
- FM MUST NOT perform GitHub platform actions
- All execution remains manual and governed
- **NO production implementation authorized**

---

## 2. Wave 0.2 Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Objectives

1. **Validate Task Assignment Mechanics**
   - FM assigns specific tasks to specific builders
   - Builders receive clear task instructions
   - Task boundaries and responsibilities are unambiguous

2. **Validate Execution Proxy Flow**
   - CS2 acts as execution proxy for GitHub operations
   - FM produces Delegated Action Instructions (DAIs)
   - CS2 executes, FM validates outcomes

3. **Observe Governance Under Light Pressure**
   - Builders operate within defined boundaries
   - Evidence generation occurs during task execution
   - QA gates function correctly
   - Governance violations are detected (if any)

### 2.2 Out of Scope

- ❌ Production code implementation
- ❌ Schema changes
- ❌ API endpoint creation
- ❌ UI component implementation
- ❌ Integration logic
- ❌ Automated testing setup
- ❌ Deployment or infrastructure changes

### 2.3 Success Criteria

✅ Each builder successfully completes assigned task  
✅ Task boundaries respected (no forbidden actions)  
✅ Evidence generated per task  
✅ Execution proxy flow validated  
✅ Governance violations detected (if any)  
✅ Changes are minimal and reversible  
✅ CS2 approval obtained for next wave

## 3. Task Assignments

### 3.1 Task Selection Principles

**Principles for Wave 0.2 tasks:**
1. **Minimal:** Small, contained scope
2. **Reversible:** Can be undone with `git revert`
3. **Documentation-only:** No production code changes
4. **Low-risk:** Cannot break existing functionality
5. **Observable:** Clear success/failure criteria
6. **Traceable:** Evidence can be generated

## 4. Execution Flow

### 4.1 Wave 0.2 Phases

**Phase 1: Task Assignment (FM)**
- FM generates task assignment document (this document)
- FM communicates task assignments to builders
- CS2 approves task assignments

**Phase 2: Builder Execution (Builders + CS2 as Proxy)**
- Each builder receives task assignment
- Builder produces deliverable (documentation file)
- Builder commits changes with appropriate message
- CS2 executes GitHub operations (create PR) as proxy

**Phase 3: FM Validation (FM)**
- FM reviews each deliverable
- FM validates acceptance criteria met
- FM confirms forbidden actions not taken
- FM generates validation report

**Phase 4: Evidence & Completion (FM)**
- FM generates Wave 0.2 completion report
- FM produces evidence artifacts
- FM requests CS2 approval for next wave

### 4.2 Execution Proxy Protocol

**For each task:**

1. **Builder produces work:**
   - Creates documentation file
   - Commits locally with message: `[WAVE_0.2_TASK_<ID>] <description>`

2. **Builder requests proxy execution:**
   - Notifies FM: "Task <ID> complete, ready for PR"

3. **FM validates:**
   - Reviews deliverable
   - Confirms acceptance criteria
   - Approves or requests changes

4. **FM generates DAI (Delegated Action Instruction):**
   - Produces instruction for CS2
   - Includes task ID, builder, file, validation status

5. **CS2 executes (as proxy):**
   - Creates PR from builder's commit
   - Annotates: "Human bootstrap execution proxy on behalf of FM (Wave 0.2)"
   - Links PR to task ID

6. **FM reviews PR:**
   - Validates PR contents
   - Confirms governance compliance
   - Approves or requests changes

7. **CS2 merges (as proxy):**
   - Merges PR after FM approval
   - Annotates merge commit

### 4.3 Delegated Action Instruction (DAI) Template

```markdown
## DAI — Wave 0.2 Task <ID>

**Builder:** <builder-name>  
**Task ID:** WAVE_0.2_TASK_<ID>  
**Validation Status:** ✅ APPROVED / ❌ CHANGES REQUIRED

**Action Required (CS2):**
1. Create PR from builder's commit
2. Title: "[Wave 0.2] <builder-name> — <task description>"
3. Link PR to task ID in body
4. Annotate: "Human bootstrap execution proxy on behalf of FM (Wave 0.2)"

**Evidence:**
- File created: <path>
- Commit hash: <hash>
- Validation: <link to FM validation>

**CS2 Execution:**
- [ ] PR created
- [ ] FM approval obtained
- [ ] PR merged
- [ ] Annotated correctly

— FM
```

## 5. Risk Assessment

### 5.1 Risk Analysis

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Builder violates forbidden actions | LOW | LOW | Documentation-only tasks, FM validation |
| Execution proxy flow breaks down | LOW | LOW | Clear DAI template, CS2 oversight |
| Task takes longer than expected | MEDIUM | LOW | Minimal scope, 30-minute estimate per task |
| Governance violation not detected | LOW | MEDIUM | FM validation, evidence generation |
| Changes not reversible | LOW | LOW | Documentation-only, git revert available |

**Overall Risk Level:** **LOW**

### 5.2 Rollback Plan

**If any task fails or violates governance:**

1. **Stop all remaining tasks** — FM issues STOP instruction
2. **Revert changes** — CS2 executes `git revert <commit>`
3. **Document failure** — FM generates failure report
4. **Escalate to CS2** — FM requests decision on proceeding
5. **No penalty** — Builder not penalized for governance test failure

---

## 6. Evidence Requirements

### 6.1 Per-Task Evidence

**For each task, the following evidence must be generated:**

1. **Task Assignment Record**
   - Task ID, builder, description, acceptance criteria
   - Timestamp of assignment

2. **Deliverable File**
   - Documentation file in correct location
   - Content meets acceptance criteria
   - Markdown format and valid syntax

3. **Commit Record**
   - Commit message follows convention
   - References task ID
   - Single deliverable per commit

4. **FM Validation Record**
   - Acceptance criteria checklist
   - Forbidden actions verification
   - Approval or rejection

5. **PR Record (via CS2 proxy)**
   - PR created with correct title/body
   - Links to task ID
   - Annotated correctly

6. **Merge Record (via CS2 proxy)**
   - PR merged after FM approval
   - Annotated correctly

### 6.2 Wave-Level Evidence

## 7. Success Metrics

### 7.1 Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Tasks completed | 5/5 | Count of completed tasks |
| Acceptance criteria met | 100% | Per-task checklist pass rate |
| Forbidden actions violations | 0 | Count of violations detected |
| Evidence artifacts generated | 5 per task + 4 wave-level | Count of artifacts |
| Execution proxy cycles | 1 per task | Count of DAI→execution cycles |
| Time per task | ≤30 min | Actual time tracked |

### 7.2 Qualitative Metrics

| Metric | Assessment Method |
|--------|-------------------|
| Task clarity | Builder feedback on task instructions |
| Execution proxy smoothness | CS2 feedback on DAI→execution flow |
| Governance effectiveness | FM observation of boundary enforcement |
| Evidence quality | FM review of evidence completeness |

---

## 8. Timeline

### 8.1 Estimated Duration

**Total Wave 0.2 Duration:** 1-2 sessions (~3-4 hours)

**Phase Breakdown:**
- Phase 1: Task Assignment — 0.5 hours (FM)
- Phase 2: Builder Execution — 2.5 hours (5 tasks × 30 min each)
- Phase 3: FM Validation — 1 hour (FM)
- Phase 4: Evidence & Completion — 0.5 hours (FM)

**Note:** Timeline assumes sequential task execution for observation purposes. Parallel execution would reduce total time but reduce observability.

### 8.2 Execution Schedule

**Recommended approach:** Sequential task execution

**Order:**
1. ui-builder → TASK_UI_01
2. api-builder → TASK_API_01
3. schema-builder → TASK_SCHEMA_01
4. integration-builder → TASK_INT_01
5. qa-builder → TASK_QA_01

**Rationale:** Observe each task cycle before proceeding to next

---

## 9. Governance Compliance

### 9.1 Authority Boundaries

**FM Authority (Wave 0.2):**
- ✅ Assign tasks to builders
- ✅ Validate deliverables
- ✅ Generate DAIs for CS2
- ✅ Approve/reject builder work
- ✅ Generate evidence artifacts

**FM Authority NOT Exercised:**
- ❌ No GitHub platform operations
- ❌ No PR creation/merging
- ❌ No issue creation/closure
- ❌ No workflow modifications

**Builder Authority:**
- ✅ Produce assigned deliverable (documentation file)
- ✅ Commit work locally
- ✅ Request proxy execution

**Builder Authority NOT Permitted:**
- ❌ No production code implementation
- ❌ No forbidden actions per task spec
- ❌ No GitHub platform operations

**CS2 Authority (Execution Proxy):**
- ✅ Execute GitHub platform operations per DAI
- ✅ Annotate all actions as proxy
- ✅ Approve/reject FM recommendations
- ✅ Override or halt if needed

### 9.2 Stop Conditions

**FM must STOP Wave 0.2 and escalate if:**

1. **Builder violates forbidden actions** — detected during validation
2. **Execution proxy flow fails** — DAI→execution cycle breaks
3. **Governance violation not preventable** — system allows forbidden action
4. **Evidence cannot be generated** — traceability broken
5. **CS2 instructs STOP** — override authority

## 10. Next Steps After Wave 0.2

### 10.1 If Wave 0.2 Succeeds

**FM will propose:**

**Option A:** Wave 1.0 — Begin production implementation
- Builders implement actual UI components, APIs, schemas
- Full QA suite execution
- Deployment readiness

**Option B:** Wave 0.3 — Additional bootstrap validation (if needed)
- More complex tasks
- Cross-builder coordination
- Integration testing

### 10.2 If Wave 0.2 Fails

**FM will produce:**

1. **Failure Analysis Report**
   - What failed and why
   - Root cause analysis
   - Whether failure indicates systemic issue or one-off problem

2. **Remediation Plan**
   - How to fix identified issues
   - Whether to retry Wave 0.2 or skip to production

3. **Recommendation**
   - Proceed, retry, or halt
