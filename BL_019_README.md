## Understanding the Problem

### The Pattern (BL-018 → BL-019)

**BL-018 (First Occurrence):**
- Date: 2026-01-05
- Subwave: 2.2 (Parking Station Advanced)
- Issue: QA-376 to QA-385 claimed for parking, but allocated to network/resource failure modes
- Response: Created ratchet (`WAVE_2_EXECUTION_RATCHET_QA_CATALOG_VERIFICATION.md`)

**BL-019 (Second Occurrence):**
- Date: 2026-01-05 (SAME DAY)
- Subwaves: 2.3, 2.10, 2.13, plus 6 more with partial/undefined alignment
- Issue: SAME PATTERN — QA IDs claimed for features but allocated to different content
- Response: **THIS INVESTIGATION**

**Why Second-Time is CATASTROPHIC:**
- First failure: Planning gap (expected, documented)
- Second failure: Failed to apply learning (unacceptable)
- RCA principle: "Prevent it from reoccurring" was violated

## Key Statistics

### Forward-Scan Summary

| Alignment Status | Count | Percentage | Subwaves |
|-----------------|-------|------------|----------|
| ✅ Aligned | 5 | 36% | 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 2.11, 2.12 |
| ❌ Misaligned | 6 | 43% | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 2.9, 2.10 |
| ⚠️ Undefined | 3 | 21% | 2.4, 2.13, 2.14 |
| **Require Correction** | **9** | **64%** | **Most of Wave 2** |

### Validation Script Output

```
Total Subwaves: 14
✅ Aligned: 5
⚠️ Partial: 0
❌ Misaligned: 6
⚠️ Undefined: 3

❌ VALIDATION FAIL
BLOCKING: Cannot authorize ANY Wave 2 subwave until corrected
```

---

## Decision Framework

### Option A: Execute Full Correction (Recommended)

**What It Means:**
- Extend QA_CATALOG.md with 130 new QA components (QA-401 to QA-600)
- Create QA-to-Red tests for all 9 misaligned/undefined subwaves
- Regenerate all 9 subwave specification files
- Update all Wave 2 planning documents
- Apply mandatory validation gate to ALL future authorizations

**Timeline:** 8-12 days

**Priority:**
- Day 1: Unblock Subwave 2.3 (Issue #402)
- Days 2-7: Correct remaining 8 subwaves
- Days 8-9: Validation and authorization

**Pros:**
- Wave 2 continues after correction
- Creates permanent validation mechanism
- Demonstrates governance enforcement
- Builder trust maintained

**Cons:**
- 8-12 day delay
- Significant rework (9 of 14 subwaves)

**Recommendation:** CHOOSE THIS if Wave 2 execution is priority.

---

### Option B: Suspend Wave 2

**What It Means:**
- Immediately suspend all Wave 2 execution
- Escalate to governance level
- Address at constitutional/structural level
- Resume Wave 2 after governance resolution

**Timeline:** TBD (depends on governance process)

**Pros:**
- Allows deeper structural fixes
- Can address at constitutional level first
- May prevent similar issues in Wave 3+

**Cons:**
- Wave 2 delayed indefinitely
- Builder (api-builder) waiting on Issue #402
- May require Wave 2 re-planning from scratch

**Recommendation:** CHOOSE THIS if governance resolution is priority.

## How to Execute Option A

### Day 1 Priority: Unblock Subwave 2.3

**Step 1: Extend QA Catalog**
- Add QA-426 to QA-435 to `QA_CATALOG.md`
- Definitions provided in `WAVE_2_EMERGENCY_CORRECTIVE_ACTION_PLAN_BL_019.md`

**Step 2: Create QA-to-Red Tests**
- File: `tests/wave2_0_qa_infrastructure/test_system_optimizations_phase1.py`
- 10 tests (QA-426 to QA-435)
- All RED (raise NotImplementedError)

**Step 3: Regenerate Subwave Specification**
- Update `wave2_builder_issues/SUBWAVE_2.3_API_BUILDER_SYSTEM_OPTIMIZATIONS_PHASE1.md`
- Change QA range from QA-341 to QA-350 → QA-426 to QA-435
- Update test file references

**Step 4: Complete Verification Checklist**
- Use `WAVE_2_EXECUTION_RATCHET_QA_CATALOG_VERIFICATION.md`
- All items must be checked
- FM written approval required

**Step 5: Run Validation Script**
```bash
python3 validate-wave2-qa-alignment.py
# Subwave 2.3 should now show ✅ ALIGNED
```

**Step 6: Post Unblocking Comment on Issue #402**
- Template provided in `WAVE_2_EMERGENCY_CORRECTIVE_ACTION_PLAN_BL_019.md`
- Include new QA range, test location, and authorization

**Step 7: Authorize api-builder**
- Builder can proceed with corrected specification

### Days 2-9: Remaining Corrections

Follow same pattern for:
- Day 2: Subwave 2.1 (QA-401 to QA-415)
- Day 3: Subwave 2.2 (QA-416 to QA-425)
- Days 4-7: Subwaves 2.4, 2.6, 2.9, 2.10, 2.13, 2.14
- Days 8-9: Documentation, validation, final authorization

---

## Enforcement Mechanism

### Mandatory Gate Activated

**Gate Name:** QA-CATALOG-ALIGNMENT-GATE

**Before ANY Wave 2 subwave authorization:**

1. ✅ Run `python3 validate-wave2-qa-alignment.py`
   - Must exit 0 (no misalignments)
   - If exit 1, BLOCK authorization

2. ✅ Complete verification checklist
   - `WAVE_2_EXECUTION_RATCHET_QA_CATALOG_VERIFICATION.md`
   - All items must be checked

3. ✅ FM written approval
   - Signature on checklist
   - Archived in evidence folder

4. ✅ QA-to-Red tests exist and RED
   - Run tests to verify RED status
   - All tests must be NotImplementedError

**No exceptions. No bypasses.**

---

## Testing the Validation Script

### Current State (Before Corrections)
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/maturion-foreman-office-app/maturion-foreman-office-app
python3 validate-wave2-qa-alignment.py

# Expected Output:
# ❌ VALIDATION FAIL
# Exit code: 1 (BLOCKING)
```

### After Corrections (Target State)
```bash
python3 validate-wave2-qa-alignment.py

# Expected Output:
# ✅ VALIDATION PASS
# Exit code: 0 (PROCEED)
```

### Integration with CI/CD

Add to Wave 2 authorization workflow:
```bash
# Before authorizing any subwave
python3 validate-wave2-qa-alignment.py || exit 1
```

## Critical Reminders

### For FM

1. **Second-time failures are CATASTROPHIC**
   - This MUST be the last occurrence
   - Third occurrence is absolutely prohibited

2. **Forward-scan after every BL creation**
   - When BL created, scan ALL pending work
   - Correct ALL instances, not just one

3. **Validation is mandatory**
   - No authorization without exit 0
   - Checklist completion is REQUIRED
   - FM approval is REQUIRED

4. **Builder enforcement is working**
   - api-builder correctly rejected Subwave 2.3
   - Governance is protecting quality
   - Trust the builders

### For Johan

1. **This is a second-order failure**
   - Not just a planning gap (that was BL-018)
   - FM failed to apply learning retroactively
   - Governance process worked, but follow-through failed

2. **64% of Wave 2 affected**
   - This is not a small issue
   - Major rework required
   - 8-12 day impact minimum

3. **Constitutional escalation recommended**
   - Elevate "second-time prohibition" at Wave 2 reconciliation
   - Add to BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md
   - Make it permanent governance canon

## FAQ

**Q: Why didn't FM catch this before Subwave 2.3?**  
A: Wave 2.3 to 2.14 were planned BEFORE BL-018 was discovered. FM created BL-018 ratchet but failed to forward-scan and correct remaining subwaves retroactively.

**Q: Is this a governance gap or FM execution gap?**  
A: FM execution gap. Governance worked (builder rejected invalid appointment). FM failed to apply BL-018 learning to all pending work.

**Q: Can we skip the corrections and proceed?**  
A: No. Validation script will BLOCK (exit 1). Mandatory gate prevents authorization without corrections.

**Q: Why is this "BEYOND CATASTROPHIC"?**  
A: Because it's a second-time failure of the SAME pattern on the SAME DAY. RCA principle is "prevent recurrence" — this violates that principle.

**Q: What happens if we choose Option B?**  
A: Wave 2 suspended indefinitely. Issue #402 remains blocked. Governance escalation required before resuming.
