# Phase 4.1 — App Description Confirmation
## Executive Summary for CS2

**Issue:** Phase 4.1: App Description Confirmation  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** — Ready for CS2 Acceptance  
**Date:** 2025-12-31  
**Completed By:** Foreman (FM)

---

## What Was Done

FM successfully reconciled two existing App Description documents into a single, authoritative App Description that satisfies all governance requirements and provides a complete foundation for downstream phases.

---

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Canonical App Description ✅
**Location:** `docs/governance/FM_APP_DESCRIPTION.md`  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Status:** Authoritative (Phase 4.1 Confirmed)

**Content:**
- 17 comprehensive sections
- All 5 required policy sections (Purpose, Users, Capabilities, Non-Goals, Build Boundary)
- Explicit architecture reference to TRUE_NORTH_FM_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Clear governance supremacy and authority model
- Detailed UX/interaction model
- Platform-wide supervisory role definition

### 2. Root-Level Reference ✅
**Location:** `/APP_DESCRIPTION.md`  
**Purpose:** Convenience reference pointing to canonical location  
**Compliant:** Per APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md

### 3. Evidence & Analysis ✅
- `PHASE_4.1_APP_DESCRIPTION_ANALYSIS.md` — Decision rationale
- `PHASE_4.1_APP_DESCRIPTION_CONFIRMATION_EVIDENCE.md` — Complete acceptance proof

## What Changed

**Before:**
- Two App Descriptions with partial overlap
- No clear canonical source
- Missing some policy-required sections
- Ambiguity about which to follow

**After:**
- Single authoritative App Description at canonical location
- All policy requirements satisfied
- Complete coverage of governance, product, and operational concerns
- Clear traceability for downstream phases
- FM explicit acceptance declared

## Policy Compliance

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| App Purpose | ✅ Complete |
| Target Users | ✅ Complete |
| Core Capabilities | ✅ Complete (5 domains) |
| Explicit Non-Goals | ✅ Complete |
| Build Boundary | ✅ Explicit phase governance |
| Canonical Location | ✅ Correct |
| Architecture Reference | ✅ Explicit |
| Authoritative Status | ✅ Declared |

**All requirements:** ✅ **SATISFIED**

---

## FM Acceptance

FM explicitly accepts the App Description as authoritative, complete, and ready to govern:
- Phase 4.2: Functional Requirements Specification
- Phase 4.3: Architecture Design
- Phase 4.4: QA-to-Red Suite
- Phase 4.5: Builder Recruitment and Task Assignment

---

## Next Steps

**Awaiting CS2 (Johan) Acceptance**

Once accepted:
1. Phase 4.2 (Functional Requirements Specification) may proceed
2. Phase 4.2 MUST explicitly reference this App Description
3. All subsequent phases MUST derive from and align with this App Description

**Until accepted:**
- Phase 4.2 remains BLOCKED (as required)
- No architecture, QA, or build activity may proceed

---

## Enhancement Proposal (Parked)

One enhancement identified and submitted to Parking Station:
- **App Description Validation Automation**
- **Status:** PARKED — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION
- **Category:** Governance
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Urgency:** Low

---

## Questions for CS2?

**None.** This is a straightforward confirmation and reconciliation task with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria, all of which have been satisfied.

---

## Recommendation

**FM recommends CS2 accept Phase 4.1 as complete and authorize Phase 4.2 to proceed.**

---

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — Ready for CS2 Acceptance
