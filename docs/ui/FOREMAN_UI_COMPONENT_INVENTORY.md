- **Evidence Store** — Evidence artifact cache
- **Governance State** — Authority and compliance status

---

## UI Framework & Libraries

**Recommended Stack:**
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or Zustand
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library:** shadcn/ui or Radix UI
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts or D3.js

- **Tablet:** 768x1024 (secondary support)
- **Mobile:** 375x667 (view-only, limited interaction)

---

## Accessibility Requirements

Components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Focus indicators
- ARIA labels where appropriate

---

## Performance Targets

- **Initial Load:** <2 seconds
- **Component Render:** <100ms
