Vulnerability Module — Development Sprint Plan
Version: 1.0
Aligned with: Maturion SRMF Architecture & One-Time Build Philosophy

0. PURPOSE

This Sprint Plan defines the sequenced, risk-free, deterministic implementation approach for the Vulnerability Module.

It provides:

Clear sprint breakdown

Cross-team coordination points

Dependencies

Deliverables & acceptance criteria

Co-Pilot tasks vs. human tasks

Risk mitigation strategy

Integration milestones across Threat → RA → WRAC → PIT

This is a Foreman-controlled execution plan.

1. HIGH-LEVEL SPRINT STRUCTURE

The Vulnerability Module will be implemented in 5 Sprints, each lasting 7 days, with optional buffers for QA and refactoring.

Sprint 1 — Foundation (Architecture + Schema + Core Create/Edit)
Sprint 2 — Evidence + TVRE Engine
Sprint 3 — UE + RA/WRAC Integration
Sprint 4 — PIT Integration + Watchdog + AI Layer
Sprint 5 — Full QA + Exports + Final UI Polish + Release

2. SPRINT 1 — FOUNDATION (Week 1)

TVRE produces stable, deterministic relevance scores

Invalid threat-vulnerability pairs flagged correctly

Relevance score visible in UI

4. SPRINT 3 — UE GENERATION + RA + WRAC (Week 3)
Goal:

Enable end-to-end flow into RA and WRAC.

Deliverables:
4.1 Unwanted Event Generator (UEG)

UE generation engine

UE edit/approve UI

AI-generated UE sentences

Linked to threat version + vulnerability version

4.2 RA Integration

Priority & appetite flags

Acceptance Criteria:

Fully functional pipeline:
Threat → Vulnerability → UE → RA → WRAC

UE generation correct and grammatically accurate

RA entries appear instantly

WRAC shows correct current & projected risk

5. SPRINT 4 — PIT INTEGRATION + WATCHDOG + AI LAYER (Week 4)

Enable escalation to PIT, real-time updates, and embed the AI ecosystem.

Deliverables:
5.1 PIT Integration

PIT escalation rules

PIT push panel

Control mapping

Implementation progress reflection

5.2 Watchdog
