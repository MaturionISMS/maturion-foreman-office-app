**Archived:** 2025-12-31  
**Reason:** Superseded by Phase 4.2 Deliverable  
**Archived By:** Foreman (FM)

## Context

These functional specification documents were created during architecture recovery phases and represent earlier attempts to define system requirements.

They have been **superseded** by the authoritative Phase 4.2 deliverable:

**`/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md` (Version 1.0)**

Created: 2025-12-31  
Authority: Derived from App Description (Phase 4.1)  
Status: Binding contract for Phase 4.3 (Architecture), Phase 4.4 (QA-to-Red), Phase 4.5 (Builder Tasks)

- **Derivation:** TRUE_NORTH_FM_ARCHITECTURE.md v1.0
- **Reason for Archive:** Superseded by Phase 4.2 FRS which derives from App Description

### 2. FM_FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md
- **Earlier functional specification**
- **Reason for Archive:** Superseded by Phase 4.2 FRS

### 3. FM_FUNCTIONAL_SPEC_GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT.md
- **Governance alignment documentation**
- **Reason for Archive:** Superseded by Phase 4.2 FRS

### 4. FM_FUNCTIONAL_SPEC_V1.1.0_CHANGE_SUMMARY.md

## Governance Position

Per the **Platform Readiness Reset & Build Initiation Plan**:

1. **Phase 4.1** produced authoritative App Description
2. **Phase 4.2** produced authoritative FRS (derived from App Description)
3. **Phase 4.3** will produce Architecture (derived from FRS and App Description)

The documents archived here were created during earlier recovery phases and do not align with the current governance-first build sequence.

## Why These Documents Were Superseded

### Derivation Source Mismatch
- Archived documents derived from architecture
- Phase 4.2 FRS derives from App Description
- Per BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md: Requirements must precede architecture

### Scope and Structure
- Archived documents focused on implementation-level requirements
- Phase 4.2 FRS focuses on behavioral, testable requirements
- Phase 4.2 FRS includes explicit non-requirements

### Governance Alignment
- Phase 4.2 FRS explicitly aligns with Platform Readiness Reset plan
- Phase 4.2 FRS serves as binding contract for downstream phases
- Phase 4.2 FRS includes FM acceptance declaration

## Reference Only

These archived documents are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Context on earlier recovery efforts
- Comparison with Phase 4.2 approach

**They are NOT authoritative and MUST NOT be used for implementation, QA, or builder task scoping.**

---

## Current Authority

For all functional requirements, use:

**`/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md` (Version 1.0)**

This is the **single, authoritative source** for functional requirements as of Phase 4.2.
