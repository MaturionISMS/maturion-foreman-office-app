## What This Means

This file has been relocated to the **maturion-foreman-governance** repository to:
- Centralize FM-level governance artefacts
- Separate governance from implementation
- Maintain a single source of truth for governance policies, contracts, and specifications

## How to Access

Visit the canonical location above to access the current version of this document.

## Repository Structure

FM-level governance is now organized in the maturion-foreman-governance repository under:
- `governance/policies/` - Governance policies and rules
- `governance/contracts/` - Contracts and checklists
- `governance/specs/` - Specifications and standards
- `governance/dashboards/` - Dashboard specifications

This change is normalization only. No enforcement, CI, doctrine, or runtime changes were made.
