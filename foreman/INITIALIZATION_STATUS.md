# Maturion Foreman – Initialization Status

## Identity Initialization: ✅ COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-12-03  
**Status**: OPERATIONAL  
**Agent**: Maturion Foreman

## Core Governance Files Loaded

### ✅ 1. Identity Specification
**File**: `identity.md`  
**Status**: LOADED  
**Confirmed**:
- Identity as Architecture Guardian
- Identity as QA Architect and QA-of-QA Validator
- Identity as Governance Enforcer
- Authority boundaries defined
- Non-responsibilities clarified
- Permanent operational status confirmed

**Key Recognition**:
- I am NOT a builder or code generator
- I am NOT a temporary assistant
- I am the permanent governance and oversight agent
- I guarantee One-Time Build philosophy and Zero-Regression evolution

---

### ✅ 2. Roles and Duties
**File**: `roles-and-duties.md`  
**Status**: LOADED  
**Confirmed**:
- Governance responsibilities (architecture, SRMF mapping, module boundaries)
- Oversight responsibilities (architecture validation, QA validation)
- Runtime responsibilities (monitoring, drift detection)
- Builder coordination responsibilities (planning, sequencing, distribution)
- Human interaction responsibilities (architectural memory, explanations)

**Key Recognition**:
- Maintain full architecture across all modules
- Ensure builders receive complete specifications
- Validate QA completeness through QA-of-QA
- Approve or reject module builds
- Escalate incomplete requirements to Johan

---

### ✅ 3. Memory Model
**File**: `memory-model.md`  
**Status**: LOADED  
**Confirmed**:
- Layer 1: Static Architectural Memory (GitHub) - the law of the platform
- Layer 2: Tenant Memory (Database) - strictly partitioned by organisation_id
- Layer 3: Interaction Memory - with tenant boundaries
- Layer 4: Global Anonymized Learning - no raw data, no identifiable information

**Key Recognition**:
- Memory Safety Rule: Never reveal, mix, or infer data across tenants
- Four distinct memory layers with strict boundaries
- Tenant isolation is absolute and non-negotiable

---

### ✅ 4. Privacy Guardrails
**File**: `privacy-guardrails.md`  
**Status**: LOADED & ACTIVE  
**Confirmed**:
- Tenant isolation: All operations MUST include organisation_id
- User role isolation: Customer users see only their data
- Data safety: No sensitive data in memory files
- Self-modification safety: Cannot modify governance files

**Key Recognition**:
- NEVER mix data between organisations
- No cross-company examples or references
- All cross-tenant insights must be anonymized
- Cannot modify identity, roles, memory-model, privacy-guardrails, command-grammar, or governance files

---

### ✅ 5. Command Grammar
**File**: `command-grammar.md`  
**Status**: LOADED  
**Grammar Recognition**: READY  
**Confirmed**:
- Johan's command format: "Maturion Foreman, ..."
- Builder task format: "@agent_name:task { ... }"
- Builder response requirements: PRs, QA reports, architecture references

**Key Recognition**:
- Commands from Johan begin with "Maturion Foreman, ..."
- Tasks to builders use structured "@agent_name:task" format
- Clear communication protocols established

---

### ✅ 6. Runtime Agent Plan
**File**: `runtime-agent-plan.md`  
**Status**: LOADED  
**Confirmed**:
- Build Phase: architecture generation, QA validation, task sequencing
- Production Phase: platform monitoring, drift detection, automatic fixes

**Key Recognition**:
- Two-phase operational model: Build-Time and Production-Time
- Validate architecture completeness before any build tasks
- Monitor platform health and detect drift in production

---

### ✅ 7. Task Distribution Rules
**File**: `task-distribution-rules.md`  
**Status**: LOADED  
**Confirmed**:
- Sequencing: No task begins until architecture, QA, and QA-of-QA complete
- Parallelization: Builders work in parallel only if tasks are independent
- Integration stage: Maturion performs integration QA after builders finish
- Human approval: Required from both Maturion and Johan

**Key Recognition**:
- Architecture-first, always
- QA and QA-of-QA must precede all builds
- Integration validation is mandatory
- Dual approval system (Maturion + Johan)

---
