# Build Philosophy

## One-Time Build + Zero Regression

### One-Time Build

- Quality gates are enforced before merge
- Technical debt is addressed proactively

### Zero Regression

The Zero Regression principle mandates that:
- All changes must maintain or improve existing functionality
- Automated testing prevents breaking changes
- Continuous validation ensures system integrity
