## Executive Summary

This document defines Wave 0.1 scope under Batch 3B Bootstrap recruitment. Wave 0.1 establishes the builder agent roster, validates builder initialization, and locks scope for subsequent build waves.

**FM Role:** Planning and sequencing authority  
**CS2 Role:** Execution proxy for GitHub platform actions  
**Builders:** To be recruited and assigned tasks

2. **Builder Validation:** Validate builder configurations and specifications
3. **Scope Lock:** Define and freeze the scope for this bootstrap wave
4. **Readiness Certification:** Produce evidence that builders are ready

### 1.2 Out of Scope

- Implementation of production code
- Modification of governance files
- GitHub platform operations (issues, PRs, merges)
- Automation or delegation setup
- Build execution beyond Wave 0 planning

### 1.3 Success Criteria

✅ All 5 builders recruited and validated  
✅ Builder manifest confirmed accurate  
✅ Builder specifications reviewed and approved  
✅ Wave 0.1 scope documented and locked  
✅ Evidence artifacts generated and audit-ready  
✅ CS2 approval obtained for proceeding to next wave

## 6. Authority & Boundaries

### 6.1 FM Authority (Within Scope)

FM may:
- ✅ Plan and sequence Wave 0.1 tasks
- ✅ Recruit builders from manifest
- ✅ Validate builder configurations
- ✅ Generate documentation and evidence
- ✅ Request CS2 approval
- ✅ Provide recommendations

### 6.2 FM Authority (Out of Scope)

FM may NOT:
- ❌ Open/close GitHub issues
- ❌ Create/merge/close PRs
- ❌ Modify repository settings
- ❌ Trigger/modify workflows
- ❌ Assign builders directly to issues (CS2 must execute)
- ❌ Enable automation or delegation
- ❌ Bypass governance gates

### 6.3 CS2 Role (Execution Proxy)

CS2 (Johan) responsibilities:
- Execute GitHub platform actions on FM instruction
- Approve scope and readiness certifications
- Provide human validation at gates
- Act as execution proxy until delegation operational

All CS2 actions must be annotated:
> "Human bootstrap execution proxy on behalf of FM (Wave 0)"

---

## 7. Stop Conditions

FM must STOP and escalate if:

1. **Role Boundary Violation**
   - If FM is asked to perform GitHub platform operations directly
   - If builders are instructed to bypass FM authority chain

2. **Governance Violation**
   - If governance files are missing or invalid
   - If builder specifications are incomplete or contradictory

3. **Red Gate Declaration**
   - If validation reveals critical issues
   - If builder readiness cannot be certified

4. **Missing Evidence**
   - If required artifacts cannot be generated
   - If traceability cannot be established

5. **Ambiguity in Authority**
   - If unclear whether FM or CS2 should execute an action
   - If builder boundaries are unclear

---

## 8. Completion Criteria

Wave 0.1 is complete when:

✅ All 5 builders recruited  
✅ All builders validated (init_builders.py passes)  
✅ All deliverables generated  
✅ Evidence artifacts are audit-ready  
✅ CS2 approval obtained  
✅ Scope lock confirmed  

---

## 9. Next Steps (Post Wave 0.1)

After Wave 0.1 completion:

1. **Wave 0.2 Proposal** (if required)
   - Define next bootstrap wave scope
   - Sequence tasks for builder assignment
   - Generate architecture or QA artifacts

2. **Builder Task Assignment**
   - Begin assigning builders to specific tasks
   - Follow task distribution rules
   - Maintain evidence chain

3. **Governance Gate Validation**
   - Ensure all gates are operational
   - Test governance enforcement
   - Validate QA-of-QA readiness
