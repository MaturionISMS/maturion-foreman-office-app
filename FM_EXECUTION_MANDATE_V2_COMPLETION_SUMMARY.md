# FM Execution Mandate v2.0.0 — Completion Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-02  
**Issue**: 🔑 FM Execution Mandate (Authoritative Re-Issuance)  
**Status**: ✅ Complete — Ready for Governance Review  
**Document**: `governance/contracts/FM_EXECUTION_MANDATE.md`

---

## Executive Summary

The FM Execution Mandate has been **authoritatively re-issued** as **version 2.0.0**, incorporating all requirements specified in the issue and fully aligning with the refactored FM agent contract (v3.0.0) and all 13 Tier-0 canonical governance documents.

This mandate now serves as the **constitutional execution authority declaration** for Maturion Foreman, explicitly stating:
- Authority and delegation boundaries
- Ripple intelligence responsibilities
- Builder appointment preconditions
- Execution invariants including the One-Time Build Law
- Enhanced STOP conditions
- Consistency verification with governance canon

---

## Changes from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

### 1. Enhanced Constitutional Grounding (Section I)

**What Changed**:
- Added explicit reference to all 13 Tier-0 canonical governance documents
- Added reference to supporting governance documents (FM_RIPPLE_INTELLIGENCE_SPEC.md, FM_OPERATIONAL_GUIDANCE.md, FM_CONSTITUTIONAL_ALIGNMENT_VERIFICATION.md)
- Strengthened mandate authority statement

**Why Important**:
- Provides complete constitutional binding
- Eliminates ambiguity about governance basis
- Ensures FM operates under full Tier-0 authority

---

### 2. NEW: Ripple Intelligence Responsibilities (Section IV)

**What Added**:
- Ripple Intelligence Authority declaration
- Ripple Reception Obligation (mandatory)
- Downstream Coherence Obligation
- Ripple Escalation Boundaries (hard stop)

**Why Important**:
- Addresses the major gap identified in issue requirements
- Ensures FM is responsible for interpreting and coordinating ripple context
- Mandates downstream coherence when ripples affect execution
- Defines clear escalation boundaries for governance-affecting ripples

**Reference**: Detailed specification in `governance/specs/FM_RIPPLE_INTELLIGENCE_SPEC.md`

---

### 3. NEW: Builder Appointment Preconditions (Section V)

**What Added**:
- Builder Appointment Gate with 5 mandatory preconditions:
  1. Ripple Alignment Verification
  2. Architecture Freeze Confirmation
  3. QA-to-Red Compilation
  4. Platform Readiness Verification
  5. Builder Recruitment Completion
- Appointment Authority statement

**Why Important**:
- Ensures builders are never appointed on stale assumptions
- Prevents execution under ripple ambiguity
- Enforces architecture freeze and QA-to-Red prerequisites
- Clarifies exclusive FM authority for builder appointment

---

### 4. Enhanced Platform Execution & Delegation Boundary (Section VI)

**What Changed**:
- Reorganized and strengthened from previous Sections V and VI
- Added explicit "Authority vs. Execution Separation" constitutional statement
- Clarified delegation model: FM (authority) → Maturion (execution) → GitHub
- Enhanced Bootstrap Proxy Model explanation
- Added Bootstrap Mode Termination conditions

**Why Important**:
- Eliminates ambiguity about platform boundary
- Reinforces that FM authors intent, CS2/Maturion executes mechanically
- Preserves 100% authority with FM during bootstrap mode
- Clarifies transition path to full delegated execution

---

### 5. NEW: Execution Invariants (Section VII)

**What Added**:
- Supreme Principle: One-Time Build Law
- Mandatory Enforcement (6 specific MUST/MUST NOT rules)
- Other Execution Invariants (6 constitutional requirements)

**Why Important**:
- Explicitly states One-Time Build Law as supreme principle
- Makes enforcement requirements unambiguous
- Codifies all execution invariants in one place
- Aligns with BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md (T0-001)

---

### 6. Enhanced STOP and Escalation Semantics (Section IX)

**What Changed**:
- Added new category: **Ripple Intelligence Issues** (Category 6)
  - Active ripple signal not acknowledged or addressed
  - Ripple affects governance canon without escalation
  - Ripple affects FM agent contract without escalation
  - Downstream coherence cannot be verified
  - Builder contracts may be stale after ripple
- Renumbered existing "Blocking Conditions" to Category 7

**Why Important**:
- Ensures FM STOPS when ripple issues arise
- Prevents execution under ripple ambiguity
- Aligns with ripple intelligence responsibilities
- Protects against stale agent assumptions

---

### 7. Enhanced Acceptance Criteria (Section XII)

**What Changed**:
- Expanded from 8 criteria to 13 criteria
- Added criteria for:
  - Tier-0 canonical binding
  - Platform boundary clarification
  - Execution invariants
  - Ripple intelligence responsibilities
  - Builder appointment preconditions
  - Ripple-related STOP triggers
  - Consistency verification

**Why Important**:
- Reflects all new requirements from v2.0.0
- Provides clear acceptance gate
- Ensures completeness before governance approval

---

### 8. NEW: Consistency & Contradiction Check (Section XVI)

**What Added**:
- Internal Consistency Declaration (with FM agent contract and all governance)
- Contradiction Analysis (explicit statement: none detected)
- Governance Coherence Statement

**Why Important**:
- Satisfies Task 2 requirement from issue
- Provides explicit verification of internal consistency
- Declares readiness for governance review
- Ensures no conflicts between mandate, contract, and canon

---

### 9. Enhanced Signature and Declaration (Section XVII)

**What Changed**:
- Updated version to 2.0.0
- Updated date to 2026-01-02
- Updated authority basis to "All 13 Tier-0 Canonical Governance Documents"
- Added "Key Enhancements in v2.0.0" summary
- Added "supersedes all previous informal execution patterns" statement

**Why Important**:
- Marks this as authoritative re-issuance
- Summarizes improvements for quick reference
- Reinforces constitutional authority

- ✅ Delegation boundary consistent
- ✅ Ripple intelligence responsibilities aligned
- ✅ STOP conditions consistent

## What Comes Next (Informational)

As stated in the issue, after this mandate is merged:

1. **Platform Reconciliation Issue** (already queued) will run
2. **FM will re-issue the Build Initiation Package**
3. **Builder recruitment and one-time build execution may begin**

This mandate serves as the **final precondition** before build initiation.

---

## Enhancement Proposals (Parked)

**Enhancement Opportunity Identified**:

> **PARKED — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION**
> 
> Future optimization: Consider automated ripple detection and coherence verification tooling to reduce manual ripple signal tracking burden on FM. This would not change FM's responsibility but would provide machine-assisted awareness.
> 
> Benefits: Reduced risk of missed ripple signals, faster downstream coherence verification.
> 
> Requires: FM authorization before execution.
